"3","I stood to my feet and followed the caseworker through double doors, down a corridor, into another corridor and into a 10x10 deluxe cubicle suite smothered in the usual gray, black and taupe cliché of office themed colors. I maneuvered my size 8 waist around the front of the caseworker's desk and casually slumped into a chair obviously meant for overweight people. The blue-marooned Beta fish residing in a tall sitting vase to my left actually stopped swimming for a sec to look my way. I meant to smile, but the fish gulped and continued on swimming. Suddenly I felt minute like a leftover morsel of undigested fish food because I was finding it hard to believe that this insignificant little thing actually had a home that wasn't facing Foreclosure. I shot the shit with the caseworker for a few minutes to reclaim my confidence until he got to the embarrassing-but forgotten-issue at hand: “Why are you here, Mrs. Davis?”"

Next came Konar Wuldcarva who shook Hermel’s hand somewhat awkwardly. A thin man with a narrow face and light brown hair introduced himself as Selig Courtsman. He had frosty blue eyes and wore a wry smile. There was another man with an austere expression, close cropped hair, and wore a tunic on which was emblazoned the symbol of the Elkron of the Sun, Eldrik. He gave a courteous bow of the head, and indicated he was interested in listening to the proposed adventure. This man was named Star of Justice, but he did not introduce himself. He simply stood and listened intently. Lastly, a redish metallic tinged grasshopper landed on Rothomon’s desk. Hermel looked over and thought to swat the insect before it leapt away. However, before he did so, Rothmon stayed his hand with a quick intercession of his hand on Hermel’s arm."

The foul undead monsters, with hateful glowing eyes, surged forward in the vision, overwhelming the cleric with their sheer numbers."

Support for priests desiring to celebrate or learn to celebrate the venerable Roman Rite is our greatest priority. While the long-term objective will always remain the development of a ""personal parish"" as was attempted with the forrmer Toronto Apostolate of the Priestly Fraternity of St. Peter, this fact will occur in God's own time and at the discretion of our Metropolitian, Archbishop Thomas Christopher Collins. Our job is to grow our membership, educate, promote, guide, train and serve the Church as Catholic laymen and laywoman towards this goal."

So The Dark Knight Rises has a difficult task of beating out that incredible sequel. The problem I have is that they aren’t giving me enough to get excited off of other than it is a sequel to The Dark Knight. The trailers didn’t impress me and the pictures released had the same effect. I am really worried by what is taking place here. Primarily because Catwoman is in this movie and I despise Catwoman. I hate her character. I find her annoying and bothersome. Also that shot in the trailer with the exploding football field was so stupid. That guy really didn’t feel the explosion. It just didn’t fit in this world Christopher Nolan has created because the scene played as a joke by having the man run for a touchdown and after succeeding notice the stadium was destroyed. I do however, love the look of Bane. Tom Hardy is a fine actor so I know he will perform with this role. There is no way he will be able to beat out Heath Ledger’s terrific take on The Joker but he will still be good. I am placing my trust in Nolan’s hands to pull this off. It won’t be as great as The Dark Knight but it will still be a good movie."

"39","Surprised? Ho Chi Minh was a political genius, tricking everyone into believing his lies. Using patriotism, nationalism, and the pretext of fighting for freedom, Ho Chi Minh demonized the Americans and defeated them in the war. It is true, Ho Chi Minh was an inspiring man. He was a charismatic individual who was able to gain support from many people inside and outside of Vietnam. However, actions speak louder than words. The crimes he committed against humanity have clearly been proven. He was a criminal, not a patriot. Thanks to him, Vietnam is now going through a phase of decline and self-destruction. He is not the hero that we all thought he was. However, I will acknowledge his title as the master of deception. He’s a tricky one."

Most notably, what was once a walkway designed to carry hikers over a boggy area is now a floating “bridge” across the beaver’s pond. In a couple of places, the bridge is submerged in a couple of inches of water. As I walked through these sections, I looked down to see minnows streaming around my boots. Also, I found the bridge rolled like a fun house walk, if I stepped too far to either side of it.

The reason President Ngo Dinh Diem gets murdered by Duong Van Minh is because of was will to oppose American imperialism. The Americans wanted him to do what they instructed him to do, something that Diem will not comply with. President Diem’s actions were in the interest of Vietnam and not the Americans. So for that reason, the American government looked for a man who was willing to do their dirty work for them. They wanted someone who hated Ngo Dinh Diem, who can’t understand the complexity of the situation and was easy to mold. The Americans discover these traits in ex-General Duong Van Minh. So on November 1, 1963, President Ngo Dinh Diem and his younger brother Ngo Dinh Nhu were kidnapped and executed the next day. Before Diem’s death, North Vietnam was kept in check, his assassination gave the Vietcong an opportunity to move in the army. After Diem died, it took three years of continuous failed governments before Nguyen Van Thieu finally emerged."

The actual figures of the Chinese Defence budget continues to be a source of conjecture and no standard factors can assist in accurate prediction of the real expenditure. The allocation for 2012 appears to suggest that ‘it is business as usual’ for the PLA, although there are reports of a substantial rise in salaries and expenditure on improving the living standards even as it finds new ways to woo young men and women to join the PLA. It would be prudent to assume that the bulk of the monies will be directed at ensuring domination of the Asia- Pacific by developing its ‘ Anti-Access Area Denial’ strategies while building on a nascent expeditionary capability for power projection and protection of its interests globally. As far as India is concerned, we will see no let up in the momentum of infrastructure development in the TAR and the possible establishment of the PLA`s first base overseas in the Indian Ocean in the near future."

With the use of hand held devices becoming more commonplace in schools, and class rooms across the country this is a very real issue that a lot of students and parents do not want to/ or will not address. In the most severe cases of cyber bullying and stalking some suicides have been blamed on this relatively new phenomonen in the high tech world.

All the girl who made the comment did was make fun of another girl’s shoes. Surely all of us have done worse. I know I have. If asked why she did it, I’m sure she would say something we hear all too often: “It was just a joke.” The girl likely could never have imagined how far the negative consequences of that “joke” could have reached. But that joke almost destroyed the life of six children. Children in garbage dumps don’t survive long.

The week before vacation I put on one of my usual pairs of jeans and came to the realization that they just didn’t fit anymore. Not only that, they looked down right funny. I’m not a girl who has ever liked to wear tight pants, we learned this lesson in the Jeggings post (and for those of you keeping track, I did wear the jegging on New Years and rocked them) so my jeans are never really tight. In fact, some might say that I’ve spent most of my life running around in jeans that don’t fit. Which is probably true because of my little buns and lack of hips.

But when reading a deceased author’s perception of the world in, well, about 2011, it’s hard not to get engrossed. There are several pages towards the end of the book—the aforementioned conversation between the Controller and the Savage—that on their own make Brave New World worth reading (and from which I will post some excerpts in coming days). Also, I imagine the book does itself more justice than did the 1998 TV-movie adaptation starring Peter Gallagher. Which…I may or may not have just added to my Netflix queue."

Paul strongly wrote in 2 Corinthians 6: 17-18, “Therefore, come out from them and separate yourselves from them, says the Lord. Don’t touch their filthy things, and I will welcome you. And I will be your Father, and you will be my sons and daughters, says the Lord” (NLT). Many Christians feel that God has alienated Himself from them… and that they are not received by God as a family member. If you feel this way… Have you joined yourself to something you shouldn’t have? Have you made any wrong compromises?"

"316","Those who opposed sanctions in the past and now accuse Israel of war-mongering share at least some of the blame for the current crisis. Since 1993, when Yitzhak Rabin first defined the Iranian nuclear threat as the ultimate existential challenge facing Israel, successive Israeli governments, along with pro-Israel American Jews, have advocated sanctions as the way to avert a choice between preemptive strike and a nuclear Iran. It took five years before the Clinton administration accepted Israel’s assessment that the goal of Iran’s nuclear program was a bomb; and it took Europe a few years longer. And then it took nearly a decade before the international community adopted the Israeli position of real sanctions. Even at this late date, that remains the Israeli position: Only devastating sanctions can break the regime’s determination to produce a bomb. When Obama complains that war talk has forced up oil prices, what are Israelis to conclude except that he will not push sanctions to the limit?"

As tired as they were from working in the dark bowels of the earth, they would play the game we all expected. They would come lumbering towards us with a wild, bear like growl and chase us around the yards. This game gave me such a delicious fear.

I can honestly say I've never in my life owned sweatpants (if you're wondering, I wore patterned leggings to gym class back in the day) and I'm not about to start. Now, I am not judging you lucky things who can pull that off, but in my own experience I've found dressing nicely helps me stay alert and focused in class, gives me some much-needed confidence when navigating the world, and shows my professors respect.

And this is the thing, publishers are always looking for the “next big thing”, they’re making and breaking trends with, it would often seem, little acceptance of the fact that the market will eat brownies and read vampires till the cows come home – and in the process, many great books simply get overlooked."

I don't know whether its the oversized body of it all, the fur or the off-green, but there's something about this piece that makes me feel artistically chic. When the military green jackets came onto the fashion trend scene, I was determined to find myself one. And luckily I didn't have to search far nor wide. One day, I was strolling with my dad around IFC Mall after work and walked into Zara with a low-expectation. You could call it love at first sight. I tried it on and fell head over heels for it. I loved how it wasn't the typical perfect-fitting jacket or the fact that it had an over-sized hoodie. I am a sucker for maxi everything and I guess my dad read my mind. But I was planning on buying it for myself after my monthly pay cheque. But on my birthday, I was presented completely off-guard with this jacket. And I have been wearing it ever since. Its the perfect piece to wear when planning to go for a more casual look, but still wanting to give a little edge."

It’s now abolished: I did the two parter I’ll call the first half of British literature and the second half. There was also a one term version; I did notice other colleagues who did the one term version especially would do a couple of famous medieval, and Renaissance works and then basically leap to the 19th century. One reason towards the end I did separate books (I did not order the Norton) was it enabled me to chose what I thought would be more popular (Fielding’s Joseph Andrews, Gay’s Beggar’s Opera), work I simply liked better (I’d use Cruttwell’s Penguin of Johnson), ” to go outside English (I’d assign Lafayette’s La Princesse de Cleves in English) …"

People have tried, certainly: he's even developed a small but respectable solo rogues gallery, mostly composed of people from Clint Barton's past who have a mad-on for whatever reason. But he doesn't have any projects, any real reason to operate, outside his team. He doesn't have Green Arrow's social conscience to propel his characterization. Hawkeye grew up a poor orphan, a boy who literally ran away to join the circus and learned everything he needed at the feet of some extremely dubious characters. For Hawkeye, being an Avenger is the best job in the world, certainly more than almost anyone else in his position could ever have dreamed of accomplishing. Whenever he's left the team - to have his own ""hard traveling hero"" moments, or to gain perspective on whatever recent setback he suffered - it's always been temporary, and often when he's left the main Avengers group it's been for the purpose of founding or joining another group, such as the West Coast Avengers or the Thunderbolts."

She was intricately made and specifically chosen for her place in time. She is my teacher. Some how she knows that we will keep her safe. She reaches her hands into a constant oblivion. She steps into open space. She swims beneath the water's surface always knowing that we, you and I, will be there to pull her up. How she does it I do not know. What faith I though I had was only a false security in my mind. I want what she has. Peace. I want to know that there is someone there to protect and rescue me, even if I can't see them."

Shiro and I have this weird relationship at this point… we’re more than friends, we mess around, but there’s no romantic interest (at least on my end). Actually we plan to sit down and try to figure out what we each want out of the relationship but that’s another issue entirely."
"566","After I talked to mum I tried to phone dad, but he was busy at work, and didn’t seem that interested in talking. He’s with his first love, his job, and I’m sure it’s much more interesting. So we just said our hellos, and chatted for a few minutes, and then hung up."
"567","Later that night she apologized in a text, but I’m still hurt over the whole ordeal. Just because she had a bad day did not mean she had to take it out on me. There are already a lot of issues over this wedding and I don’t think any of us need an Auntzilla amongst it all. Sigh…"

"572","And life was good. We made a pot of tea, grabbed laptops and mugs, blankets and pajamas, and went down to the conservatory, a green-house type thing in the middle of the compound.

"598","With the giving season upon us, you might be looking for organizations that need some holiday funds or warm body volunteers. The Lone Star Paralysis Foundation is an organization that I recently got to know through an unfortunate accident. One thing that I noticed about the Lone Star Paralysis Foundation was the immense (and I mean IMMENSE) passion and unwavering focus on the organization's goals. In meeting many of the board members, I was bombarded with warm greetings and huge smiles. Dang, that is one happy, yet intensely focused board. Since I hadn't mentioned it yet, the mission of the organization is ""to cure spinal cord paralysis through funding research, advanced recovery, and community outreach."""

"634","One obvious way in which the music had benefited the series was during the mystery buildup. The case in this episode (as with the previous episode) was really uninteresting and simple.

"637","Despite the fact that many of the people at the show were there to look at things which would improve their own lives (me included I think!) it was surprising how many meaningful conversations we had with people. The world is a small place and I met many folk who had had first hand experience about the lack of clean water in the world. Those who didn't or who thought we were flogging a new kind of water feature for their garden (well, we were on the edge of the Ideal Garden section!) were really shocked by the statistics - 1 in 8 people in the world don't have access to water and every 20 seconds a child dies because of lack of clean water."

"639","Since I started dating Trooper, I've been worried about the relationship's affect on this blog. I thought that being in an exclusive relationship would diminish my ability to share my thoughts and feelings on dating.

"645","In other words, physical signs aren’t enough to explain what stress is doing to us every day. You can’t simply “lower your stress” by avoiding pressured situations. A completely easy life, without pressure of any kind (if such a hypothetical life existed), needs only one deeply disturbing event, such as the death of a baby, to be scarred for years and change the course of a person’s existence. At the opposite extreme, stress can act like high blood pressure, which damages the body through a slight increase in stress on the cell walls, seemingly innocuous at first glance. The cell performs all of its functions without seeming distressed, and yet years later, a huge array of problems can arise."

"651","In 2006, the state Attorney General’s Office sued Mrs. Roethel, Mr. Forsythe and Mr. Wilder to recover the cost of the cleanup, alleging that they were responsible for the contamination. After arguing the case for six years, Mr. Forsythe and Mr. Wilder have settled with the state, and the state is now pressuring Mrs. Roethel to follow suit."

"653","But you see, I have a theory: the 1990s were, and will be forever be remembered as one of the high points of America’s existence. The US is a pretty new country. It doesn’t have many golden ages, but the 50s was one. If we look at a couple of the characters of the fifties: optimism, just finished a war, exporting a lot of our culture, the economy was doing well, our president played the saxophone… I may have to do more research in order to support my point, but the main idea is this: The Berlin came down in 1989. It symbolized the defeat of the Communists. We, the not-Communists, had won."

I could not find a card reader and had to crop it through whatever default photo editing software that happens to have come with my laptop. I cleaned up the painting a bit, re-shot and cropped it on hubby's computer. I think you can get the gist of it. I have another ""woodland"" landscape that I may post soon.

"666","I'm used to making lists, and systematically accomplishing things on the list. It's incredibly satisfying. However. If you make a list for someone else, someone who (perhaps) works full time and is your Lovable Beast of Burden, it can make you feel like a bit of a jerk. Especially when by the time your Lovable Beast of Burden comes home, you are SO TIRED and can not be on your feet for ONE MORE SECOND."
"667","#1. Cohort review is not an audit in the sense of a junior doctor clinical audit, but falls more in the category of continuous quality improvement, with lessons learned on the hoof, solutions thought of and shared by those on the ground ( the TB case managers) and a process of rolling review to see how improvements have impacted on the outcomes achieved."
"668","The bankomat belongs to one of the local banks and I normally go around 9:00 in the morning - the cash may well have run out overnight and not been replenished, so I do not blame Biedronka. However, what should have been a good marketing attraction has instead emphasised how useless Biedronka is as a place for me to shop. My hope to improve my familiarity with and respect for the chain has been completely eliminated."
"669","I spent last weekend with my good friends Amy and Lindsay. Amy lives in a part of Georgia that is chock full of antique stores. Yes, I said chock full of. I mean, seriously, they were everywhere. We only had one day with Amy, and had a lot on our agenda for that day, so we only went into one antique store...her favorite. It was pretty great. We tried on silly hats, laughed at creepy dolls, and scored some really great items. By far, my best find of the day was this..."
"670","Gavin went for the brill (£22.50) and I'll admit that if I had been served it, I would have been disappointed, but then I came to St John for the meat, not the fish. He had a decent chunk of perfectly cooked fish, served on the bone and Gav was happy with his choice. There was a salad of chicory which was pretty bitter and took some work from Gav to finish."
"671","L of the Book Archaeologist asked: I have a question for you, and it may fall a bit outside the purview of your blog but I’m curious. Recently I was having lunch and eavesdropped on a (very loud) conversation about marriage, divorce, and Islam. The two people talking were girls, and neither of them was obviously a Muslim (and I know appearances can be deceiving, but by this I mean neither was wearing a head scarf or anything). One was very forcibly asserting that Islam was the first religion to allow and embrace the concept of divorce. Is that true? I have to admit, I’m a bit skeptical about her claims, so I thought I would ask!"

I decided to buy it outright as I’d heard good things and I doubt I’d be disappointed, and to be honest I felt professionally compelled to see what the fuss was about. I just didn’t expect to get so hooked. The power of managing your own studio, putting out games, levelling up your dudes… it’s all so intoxicating. And it was funny to watch the scores come in as well, and get a taste of what it must be like to be on the receiving end. I wonder if there was deliberate social commentary there or whether it was designed that way simply for simplicity’s sake – scores seem to have no impact on sales what so ever, and are only relevant in getting a game into the ‘Hall of Fame’ (which allows you to make a ‘sequel’, which to me is kind of a poor gameplay mechanic, but whatever)."
"678","Makes 2 servings. Enjoy!"
"679","In order for the garden to be sustainable through the winter you need to plant a lot, and know how to store it. Last year I had about 12 tomato plants for 2 people. That’s a lot of tomatoes, and they’d rot if I didn’t preserve them. My favorite way of persevering is drying. I dried pounds of tomatoes and zucchini which I then froze in single serving. Their great in all sorts of dishes."
"680","Two awards will be made out of this one category, one for horror and one for fantasy. As many people have commented on Twitter, it’s an odd set-up, but that’s what most BFS members voted for. The explanation given before the vote was this, and I think the way the new BFS awards admin who inherited the new rules has handled it makes sense. Although the voting was divided into fantasy and horror, all those votes were counted together at the end. So four of these were the books that got the most votes, regardless of genre. Half the novel votes being ringfenced that way for fantasy does seem to have led to a more varied shortlist. The judges added two titles to this category – the books by George R.R. Martin and Jo Walton, I'd guess. I didn't read many novels from 2011 during 2011, but I went for Revenants by Daniel Mills. Though it didn't get in here, I hope it might still have a shot at best newcomer."

"684","So, I don't often talk about my real job on the blog here not because of privacy so much as just it's boring. It's a good job but it's never been something that has interested me personally. It is a position that I was very lucky to kind of fall into when we moved to Houston and I have really enjoyed working there! BUT the goal was always to find a way to do something that I am more interested in. But, problem #1: let's get real here for a second- I realize I am an (almost!) 30 year old adult woman but seriously, I don't know what I want to do when I grow up!!!"

"689","Being from the paramilitary wing of the Anglican Church I wonder whether my participation at an ordination is rather heretical. I stare blankly at the staggering amounts of pink and grey marble and gold filigree work and statues of the bleeding Jesus and the Madonna with her tacky crown of electric candles and wonder at the utter lack of spirituality that for me is the singular hallmark of Catholic places of worship. And then from the choir gallery I see all the new priest's young friends from his village beaming with pride, young children playing in the aisles, couples cuddling and people talking on their mobiles and think maybe this is the way a living church should be. Shortly afterwards Bruno says from the back of the gallery, ""hey Ron, we've just opened a bottle of grappa that Giorgio gave me, you must have a glass."""

"691","College is not an expectation. Because there often isn't that much difference in salary between someone who has gone to college for 4 years and someone who has, many people don't see the point of college if they can simply get a fun job that pays well. This may be changing as the immigrant population increases and takes over entry-level jobs, but for now, college is only something people think about when they want a promotion or certification to practice something that requires a degree."

"693","In the story Hemon talks about seeing entire Bosnian families, distinctively shaped walking down city streets completely out of their depth and comfort zone. These people were refugees, and in Ireland the war brought the first large groups of refugees to Ireland that I can recall. I remember people talking about these people as if they had jumped on the boat eager to get as much as they could from Ireland, without any consideration for what the real situation in Ireland was. Sometimes Irish people forget that so many Irish have had to leave Ireland for a lot less worse than the reasons the Bosnian people came to Ireland."

"696","My husband and I are big history nerds. We love to visit local historical societies as well as sites of national significance. It hasn’t been easy on our pocketbook, though, since most of these places charge an admission fee.

In this post, I will share how we’ve saved money on museum admission, nationwide, through the Time Travelers program."
"697","Seeing as it is unlocked Magnus flips the lid open and is blasted backwards (and knocked out) by a powerful warding glyph. Ignoring the smoking warforged his companions examine the contents of the chest. They find not one but two adamantine schema, both identical.

After reviving Magnus with some oil of mending he examines the two tablets and confirms that both are functionally identical, although it's easy to tell that one is also far, far older."
"698","All of us are at some stage on the road to eternity. As believers we are assured of it. There are some who are content to remain at the starting point; content to live as they have been living all their life. Such a person truly is not even trying to fulfil God’s eternal purpose. Then there are those who haven’t even started out on that journey to heaven. They have rejected the idea that all are sinners even though Romans 3:23clearly states that “all have sinned and come short of the glory of God.” Having rejected that God-given fact, they also reject Romans 6:23, where it says, “The wages of sin is death but the gift of God is eternal life.”"

And I do think that unschooling is a great unifying word for this philosophy of learning, and since it's becoming better known, being the term most commonly used in articles and on TV shows, I think it's become VERY useful, especially in recent times.

If that’s not what you did than you clearly hate ‘Merica (and by default, you must hate me, cheetohs, PBR and everything else that makes this country kickass too, in which case you can just move along). Anyhoo, I found myself over at Proflike's place. As I rooted around in the bushes looking for unexploded bottle rockets and unopened beers I found this meme. Seeing as how I can’t grill it, explode it or use it to intoxicate myself, I may as well post it. I’ve simplified it a bit, but hey, I’m curious. Don’t be shy. Just answer the damn questions…I’ll go make another pot of coffee. Cream? Sugar? Whiskey?"

As most of you know, she passed away this fall and there is still a little hole in my heart. I've been sorting through photos and reminiscing about the things we did as kids, young adults, and even as older adults. My Nonnie was a special lady, and I am lucky to have had almost 40 years with her. I absolutely adore this picture of my sister and I with her. Although I tease my sister that she looks like she is playing favorites here! ; ) I used my Cricut to cut all of the hearts on the background paper. Some hearts were backed with patterned paper and some were left open. The entire background was placed on dimensional foam circles for dimension. I added the title, ""Love U More...."" and added a bit of lace and twine."

"856","Several years ago, I used to write a paragraph about each child. It took so long to look at all of their assessments, then try to word a sweet, but direct, synopsis 18 different times. I decided there must be a quicker way. So, I created a checklist-style conference form. The skills closely relate to our lengthy report card. All of the ""positives"" are listed on one side and the ""let's work on these"" skills are listed on the other. Sometimes, I will put a checkmark on both sides (ex. If a child can count by 1s and 5s but not 10s, I will just circle the 1s and 5s on the ""positive side"" and then circle the 10s on the ""negative side."" ) I feel like it's a quick way for parents to see areas of praise and areas of concern."

Sometimes I add eyeliner (if I remember)."

"870","Riley also received rave review from both of his preschool teachers. They had a portfolio of his work to show me what he has been working on this fall. I'm impressed! I knew that he was making big progress lately with his numbers and letters but I didn't understand just how much. They had two separate worksheets to evaluate where he was with number and letter recognition. The numbers and letters were scattered over their individual page in no order and Riley was asked to identify each number or letter. He was only able to identify the number 1, but he identified 8 letters plus 3 others that were a close mistake such a Y for V. Apparently my expectations have been too low! We talk about the letters in his name a lot but I didn't realize he was picking up so many other letters at school. Time for mom and dad to raise the bar again. He has a little friend Howwi that he likes to play with and gives hugs to. The kids love him and keep an eye out for him but don't baby him. He loves school and guess what.....I love his school too!"

"886","Romney agrees with me that it is your choice and the government should not be involved so there should be no taxpayer money to support or deny these issues. Now I will also state here that he has said that he does not agree with abortion but really that only means he will not have one – so what? (If you are really concerned about life before birth then put time into convincing the world but again this is a social issue not a government issue – if you want it to be a government issue then get an amendment to the constitution – and lot’s of luck with that)."

I had thought I had read all of Poe's stories at least once over my life, but if I have ever read The Angel of the Odd I had totally forgotten it (and that seems unlikely). What a strange story that is - even by Poe's standards. And it reminded me of what an impact Poe made on me when I first read his stories."

"897","To conclude, Willard has adopted a very helpful pragmatic active view of discipleship. Yet, certain aspects of discipleship such as discipling others and the church’s role in discipleship were sadly absent. Discipleship surely cannot be a passive wait for a spiritual lightning bolt to shock a person into Christ’s image. Humans are spiritual beings with fleshly desires that warp them into something far removed from God’s purposes. Discipleship is, in a real sense, something that reshapes the very soul into a place focused on Christ. Discipline is a key characteristic of the life Christ lived. He set aside time for prayer, reflection, fasting, and even wilderness getaways. The reality is that Christ commanded of his disciples obedience and a change of heart, but He never told them they would go it alone. The road is narrow and rough, but nevertheless worth dying for every day. Discipleship is established solely in Christ, and accomplished through a careful and passionate following of His life and being."

The result, tribunals become another wing of the Executive. The courts left with no choice, deciphered vague norms on judicial propriety for tribunals from the doctrine of separation of powers. Although, initial pronouncements date back to 1950s, the Government is yet to formulate any uniform policy on tribunals. In the past three years alone, four tribunals have been held unconstitutional and few others are queued up before courts across the country facing similar charges."

It is important to be able to offer something useful, just as it is for any voluntary endeavour. But my belief (this may yet be proven wrong, I haven’t gone out there yet) is that we still often suffer from the patronising perspective of ‘we teach them and they learn from us.’ Perhaps selfishly I have always known that this experience will give me far more than I will be able to give back. I will try my utmost to be helpful, and share any knowledge that might be of use, but this is a voyage of self discovery for me. And because of that, I have always worried about going out with an organisation that expects me to be the giver. I am definitely the receiver of this experience, and it will be an honour and a privilege to have it."

My son has a gash, but he wasn't bleeding profusely and the gash didn't look deep or wide.

"942","There is a universal aspect to Psalm 22: all the earth will bow down because the Lord has dominion over the whole earth. The whole earth will feast and worship the Lord in Zion. As in Isaiah 25:6-8, both Israel and the nations will stream to Mount Zion to worship God. When the Lord prepares the banquet, he will remove the disgrace from his people and defeat the final enemy (Death itself). But in Isaiah 25:6-8 there is some ambiguity since the nations do come to Zion, but it is unclear that they will be worshipers or if they will face judgments. Most English translations highlight only the universalism of the text based on Christian assumptions. Jewish interpreters regularly took the banquet in Zion as time of judgment on the nations rather than universal salvation."

Fifteen minutes later she texts me ""we checked in and we're in the room"". I was like WTH? I had to control my anger at that very moment.

I was so excited that Autumn was going to allow me into her life and listen to my advice and essentially allow me to lead her. That next week I went to her foster home and we began our mentor/mentee relationship. That was three months ago and it has been going fantastically.

"974","Oh man, Ryan Adams, what have you been doing all decade? Making terrible records, that is what. Except this one. And Easy Tiger. But that isn't all that important to the point I need to make, and that is to explain how great this record is. And boy is it ever great, proving that ""country"" isn't the dirty word so many believe it to be. Though the record may have been named on the spur of the moment when Adams was put on the spot and happened to be looking at a poster of Mariah Carey wearing a shirt that read ""Heartbreaker,"" it's an apt title, as the album wallows in sadness. Adams's sad and powerful crooning lends the record its emotional core, communicating a depth of despair that just isn't possible in genres that aren't country. For all of that, the high point of the album is ""Oh My Sweet Carolina"" and Adams's duet with Emmylou Harris. Songs like that are the reason country continues to be a viable genre."

Any theory that even vaguely hints towards a ‘Central Bantu Cattle Culture’, or any image of early Africa that does not sketch a picture of exclusive Black African dominance, is simply shrugged off as a ‘misinformed’ theory. The government’s fanatical approach to this issue was clearly conveyed in an address of the Premier of Mpumalanga, Thabang Makwetla, during one of the sessions of yet another so-called ‘democratic debate’ held in February 2007 in Nelspruit.

Robert had clammed up there and then. He was still in the huff. Three days; it wasn’t a record. She knew the signs. He needed time to work through things, until they were worked out. And his temper.

Again, this is habit, from playing lots of rpgs, but we have learnt from them that doing things and rolling dice are the same thing. So what slows us down and makes us go “Hmm, my character examines the object in a thoughtful way” is the sense of squib which arises from physically picking up a die and throwing it, and the random sense of outcome also provides squib to not knowing if the scene will reveal something to our character. Without that, we had no reason to posit our characters doing something because physically, our players weren’t doing anything."

I have a pretty short attention span and if I have to do something not particularly enjoyable, I have to do it fast and push it out of the way asap. My first two exams went alright because I was pretty prepared, but I could kick myself for the third (last mid sem) because of a very embarrassing mistake, caused by too many hours watching Law and Order on TV and reading cases in my textbook involving bloody murders, torture, rape, and pedophilia - leading to me to write a rather inappropriate response to a question where the only offence involved was theft of a painting.

The girls were far more cooperative with the readying and deboarding process than expected, largely because they were still asleep. We garbed them in coats and shoes, with a rare minimum of waking or fussing. This, in and of itself, seemed like a successful feat. With a small victory behind us, we threw our packs on our backs and set out down the road in search of one of the many hotels that should be lining the street. After a 10 minute walk, Rob sees a road sign indicating that Wudangshan is 20 km away. We quickly regrouped and reassessed, realizing, a bit too late, that we should not have been so hasty in waving on the multiple minibuses that stopped to offer us a ride. We now found ourselves on the side of the road, in a small unknown town, at 0600, attempting to flag down any bus heading toward the mountain. This is when a Chinese man about our age walks by, inquiring where we’re going. “Wudangshan,” we reply, thinking this is a rather obvious answer. “it’s just up the road,” he tells us. He is also headed to the mountain, and I note that he has a spring in his step while he carries only a light day pack on his back. Rob converses briefly with the gentleman, telling him about the road sign delineating the mountain’s 20 km distance. The man, assuredly confirms that the entrance gate is only 2 km from the train station. So we walk on, happy to know that the hotels can not be far off. I am more than ready to drop off our extra bags and grab breakfast before our excursion. Another 5 minutes down the dark road (few businesses are open and the single hotel we passed was locked) the Chinese gentleman asks one of the street sweepers about the mountain’s location. She tells him it’s 30 km up the road, he chuckles, and walks on. He obviously does not think Rob understood the overheard conversation. We walk a bit further, until we find an open hotel, and we stop to confirm directions ourselves. The Chinese gentleman is long gone by now. The hotel receptionist, who awoke from her slumber on the cot behind the front desk upon our arrival, helpfully directed us to the next intersection where the green buses stop that could then carry us into our destined city."

"1208","What helps is that Flanagan frames this novel as Flynn writing his memoirs instead of simply following Flynn through the years. Flynn has a very distinctive voice; practical, wry, but with a heaping handful of melancholy. When Flynn first introduces us to his parents, he suddenly reflects on the fact that, although they’re dead now, he can still hear their voices clearly. This makes Evening’s Empire a sad, although certainly not a dark, novel. All of the Ravons are quite distinct; glamorous rock star Emerson, pretentious artist Simon, and cheerful, mischievous Charlie, who comes into the forefront towards the end of the novel, when Flynn and his family help him through chemotherapy. Danny Finnerty, who isn’t considered a real Ravon because he’s an American replacement, doesn’t figure as much, but, just when I was nervous that Flanagan was ripping on rap for no apparent reason, he unleashes a brilliant defense of the genre that went immediately into my commonplace book. Evening’s Empire is a longish novel—a little over 600 pages—but these characters carry it along throughout the years, as any good family epic should. (Although the short, thriller-esque chapters certainly help.)"

"1250","Fail Six: Is it two artichokes or half an artichoke per order? As we were waiting, the waitresses behind me were cleaning up some sort of mess on the floor with Windex. Two of them collided, and artichokes went all over the floor. Some questionable cleaning (looks like they were spreading salt or some other granulated substance thinly on the the floor) went on, and one waitress came out, looked confused, turned to our table, and offered us the plate of artichokes. We got the feeling that she forgot which table ordered it so it was easier just to give it to us. We took the plate only to discover that it was only half an artichoke and a pile of artichoke leaves arranged to look like another artichoke. I was wondering if they had intentions on sending that as a full order, because it seemed to be lacking one and a half artichokes.

I would have thought that the whole affair dumbs down Christianity to make it overly “seeker sensitive.” Now, I think differently, and here’s why. The point of it all isn’t evangelism, exactly, at least not in the sense of conveying the gospel message. There’s bigger picture stuff going on. As the producer of the ad explained, “Nobody’s going to fall on their knees and accept Jesus as a result of this spot. But advertisers on Madison Avenue spend millions on a Super Bowl spot because they know it influences people.” Yes, it’s about influence. One of the failings of the Church has been its retreat from various spheres of influence, including the media. The result? Secular values fill the void. And the American church wonders why the community around it is going to pot."

Next to the strangely ridged feather is another feather with a stiff, curved tip. When the bird raises its wings over its back, it shakes them back and forth over 100 times a second (hummingbirds typically flap their wings only 50 times a second). Each time it hits a ridge, the tip produces a sound. The tip strikes each ridge twice: once as the feathers collide, and once as they move apart again. This raking movement allows a wing to produce 14 sounds during each shake. By shaking its wings 100 times a second, the Club-winged Manakin can produce up to 1,400 single sounds during that time."

This means staying focused on the Word of God and His instructions, fortifying myself in Him, and trusting that He will provide all that is needed. In fortifying myself, I must remain steadfast in my work for the Lord and know that God is my source. I must be sober and alert lest the adversary try to spoil my work, and remain watchful so that the influence of things and people do not discourage me from doing a good work.

I wasn’t totally thrilled with Brystion, her love interest or, perhaps more rightly, her sex partner. As an incubus, he brings a lot of sexy time to A Brush of Darkness. I didn’t find him to be a super interesting character in that respect but I did appreciate the insights he brings to Abby’s nature, as a Dreamer. This is one part of the novel that I found very interesting and fun since it’s a relatively novel (ha ha, pun?) idea in the urban fantasy genre. Since being a Dreamer is something of a revelation for Abby, her exploration of what it means to be a Dreamer is a good way for the reader to learn what it’s all about, and Allison Pang does a good job of teasing what the possibilities are. I’m looking forward to reading more of Abby’s adventures, though I’m not sure when another book might be released."

Young Geoffrey of Anjou was another memorable character, a childish bully who thinks the way to make himself look big is make someone else look small and whose attitude to his marriage to Matilda is to think that he will “have an Empress at his beck and call”. Henry FitzEmpress was also convincingly drawn, no mean feat as he develops from a baby through a precocious child to the threshold of adulthood during the novel. I also liked Brian FitzCount’s wife Maude of Wallingford, doggedly getting on with the unglamorous but vital business of managing the logistics of a household under siege and reflecting that she feels “like a donkey staggering along under a heavy burden of firewood, while Brian ignored her to look at the fancy glossy horses prancing past with bells tinkling on their harness”."

Add the anxiety to sensory overload and you have a total meltdown. Although I will say that Mr. Sensitive does not have Autism (as far as we know, and he’s only been seen by half a dozen doctors); I completely emphasize with parents of kids with Autism.

The shop was full of shorty fans and we patiently inched our way inside the door as people left. Louisiana Music Factory is a tiny little music shop and it was packed. Shorty played way past 7pm and it was awesome! Right after he finished, the masses left and we crept up front for the next show. I was super excited to introduce them to some new music, Shamarr Allen. We had front row and Shamarr rocked it with his trumpet! I stole away during the set when I realized that Trombone Shorty was still inside. Yup, I got a picture with Trombone Shorty!

Coincidentally, I'd frozen 2 stacks of carrot noodle that I made the day before. It was an experiment, by adding carrot puree to the dough, to inject some colour and sweetness to my usual handmade noodle. So, I cooked a handful of the carrot noodles and curled them into the steamed dish. By now, the soy sauce was infused with the spiciness of the ginger and garlic, and sweetness of threadfin, making it a tasty dressing for the noodles."

The first was how important (and sometimes difficult) it is to control your pace. Especially when the miles start stacking up while building your base, it is often tempting to run all miles hard, but that’s a good path to injury on longer runs. Many times the distance and total time ran is more important than pace. As a race draws closer, that focus shifts, but I’m still too far out to make that shift yet."

Then this cold snap hit and wham, I made beans. Since they take about 24 hours to prepare, some planning is needed, but it’s 98 percent hands off. I’d recommend soaking the beans during the day while you’re at work and then in the evening transferring them into a crock pot, bean pot or dutch oven and cooking them slowly overnight. Add a couple hotdogs, sausages or fish cakes and you’ve got a majorly great meal. Don’t want to wait until dinner? Serve with eggs, toast and bacon for a Boston take on a full English breakfast."

"1460","For the writer, every encounter triggers a memory of an upbringing as the son of Donnie Barker, a chip-shop owner. The quality of his language makes his sense of place vivid. But he wants to know how that sense can survive the repeated process of re-appropriation a village undergoes. Once Hebden had only its ""established"": the surnames in its school were Barker, Greenwood, Sutcliffe, Ashworth. Then came the ""offcomers"", or outsiders. Affluence was a source of suspicion, not race. Now there are the new offcomers, arousing suspicions among the original invaders because they only view Hebden as a place to commute from. Barker lets the journey take him where it will, a meandering underpinned by some very incisive journalism. No assumptions: he seeks out the villagers who can help. His story of a Hebden soldier son, Edmund Ashworth, from a family album photograph though the trenches of Flanders to a lichen-encrusted memorial stone at the Talana Farm cemetery near Ypres is especially vivid. The Calder Valley was always rather forbidding for Hughes. ""Blackness was a building blocking the moors, darkening the sun of every day,"" he wrote of Mytholmroyd's Mount Zion Methodist Chapel. During an adolescence spent ""trying to detach myself from Yorkshire,"" Barker seems to have felt much the same. But in his story of one village – which might be any village in these times of change – he takes us to a very rich place indeed."

"1464","Ashwagandha (Withania somnifera L.) root extract (50, 100 and 200 mg/kg; orally) improved retention of a passive avoidance task in a step-down paradigm in mice. Ashwagandha (50, 100 and 200 mg/kg; orally) also reversed the scopolamine (0.3 mg/kg)-induced disruption of acquisition and retention and attenuated the amnesia produced by acute treatment with electroconvulsive shock (ECS), immediately after training. Chronic treatment with ECS, for 6 successive days at 24 h intervals, disrupted memory consolidation on day 7. Daily administration of ashwagandha for 6 days significantly improved memory consolidation in mice receiving chronic ECS treatment. Ashwagandha, administered on day 7, also attenuated the disruption of memory consolidation produced by chronic treatment with ECS. On the elevated plus-maze, ashwagandha reversed the scopolamine (0.3 mg/kg)-induced delay in transfer latency on day 1. On the basis of these findings, it is suggested that ashwagandha exhibits a nootropic-like effect in naive and amnesic mice. Copyright 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."

There's something that seems more believable when you know the author has been through what the main character is fgoing through, in comparison to an author researching and trying to get into a sufferer's head - not that I'm knocking it.

"1497","Before diving into the irresponsible and tawdry actions by government employees which was plastered on the front pages of the news of late, we need to first off recognize that those caught partaking of these misadventures are not indicative of government employees in general. The vast numbers of government employees are dedicated professionals who work diligently giving 100% efforts. Those who we refer to in what follows are the few bad apples in the barrel. Despite the joke about a substandard performance at a task as, “close enough for government work,” does a disservice to those who toil away, often thanklessly, in the services of the many layers of government. Most tasks performed by government employees are required to meet the same standards as similar professions must meet in the private sector, there are entire departments in government which hold their employees to an even higher standard. This editorial is about those government employees who have failed to maintain a high standard of discipline and judgment and have earned any aspersions thrown at them."

Strength was a monster with a chainsaw, Hierophant was a Gillman/fish monster, and as ToyFare put it, Johnny looked like...we'll see tomorrow. I need to see if I can dig the rest of them up, but there were several little pack-ins as well, like frog and fish monsters. Since these predate my Year-in-Toys posts, I haven't the foggiest what I actually paid for the lot of them; but I want to say they were pretty reasonable, if not dirt cheap. Fun figures for a fun game, and one I've actually played for a change!"

"1514","So the work is democratic in the realm of consumption: bright, appealing, fun, and approachable. But at the same time it is servile in production, with an uncredited army of workers carrying out tasks that don't allow for their own individual expression. And this is how it becomes a representative work for our times. Late capitalism, after all, promises us all kinds of freedoms as consumers, and courts our favor in the realm of consumption, seeking ingeniously and tirelessly to give us what we want. But in the realm of production ours is an overwhelmingly hierarchical system, with freedom of action reserved for those in positions of authority, and real constraints put on the creative expression of those lower down in the order of things. I mean, take a look at what you're wearing — unless it's a Savile Row tailor-made suit, and if you read this blog, it isn't — it was made by the skilled hands and hard work of someone who had no input on how it looks, or how it is stitched together. From sweatshops to cubicles, the story of production is often much the same."

She would accept the twenty-five cent coins, however, and some dollar coins. It didn't matter, but it was confusing. Earlier, I had paid for some metro tickets with old Canadian five-dollar bills from the same stash of money and caused some astonishment. The ticket-seller in the booth down in the metro must have been all of 25 years old. He looked at the banknotes which were probably older than he was and proclaimed them ""relics"" — he said I should hold onto such old bills because they might be valuable."

The current and expected conditions indexes for each survey moved in opposite directions this month, but once again consumers are tending to view current economic conditions and their expectations for conditions 6 months hence more optimistically."

I went to college in another state, about 500 miles away from home, but I came home for the first two summers and tried to get part-time jobs to make a few bucks. The first journalistic articles I was paid to write were for a local sports magazine called Tiger Rag. I wrote an article about the Louisiana State University cheer leading squad, which had just won a national championship. During my interview with the coach, I met the young man who had just been selected to dress in costume and play the LSU tiger mascot at the next fall’s football games. He was a wonderful, charming person, and he was tragically killed just a couple of weeks later in a car accident, before he ever got to play Mike the Tiger. It was terribly sad and made a big impression on me."

We have mostly kept to ourselves on this trip, but occasionally you meet someone on the way and you start talking.

He was subsequently branded a traitor, and never did return to his home country, living out his final years in America instead.

It can be used on either a masculine or feminine card and for almost any occasion! I colored the image with my Copics and used this month's Sketch For You To Try as my layout! I sponged the edges with some Antique Linen distress ink and embellished the card with some ribbon and buttons! Overall I absolutely love how my card turned out! The only thing I am disappointed in is the fact that my picture didn't turn out that great. I am still trying to figure out why my photos don't look as bright as they used to. Hopefully I can get it figured out soon!"
"1641","The key word in separation is “holy.” Holy (kadosh in Hebrew) is the action of separating. It is tied in with judgement, which means I separate. When I judge, I make one thing holy, I make another thing not holy. Of course, one should understand God calls us to be a holy people who are set apart from the rest of the world."

That's much better than what I could have heard, yet it is still not, ""no cancer."" There are more tests to come (some blood work, an optical scan, and if need be, some type of micro-biopsy).

This was a publication that couldn't spell decency far less demonstrate it and it simply didn't care who it trampled on to provide its 'world wide exclusive' tittle-tattle on some D list 'celebrity'. The phone hacking scandal brought its closure but it was inevitable its owner Rupert Murdoch, the News International supremo, would resurrect it in some other guise. Lo and behold, the Sun on Sunday was launched just a few short weeks ago."

"1659","The word had already been used by the philosopher Søren Kierkegaard, and Nietzsche took the sense in which Kierkegaard had used it and developed it further. It is central to understanding his Genealogy of Morals to understand what he means by ressentiment. It is a specific type of resentment which we feel when we are powerless or inferior. We project our resentment onto those who are more powerful than us or superior to us, so that we blame them for our failings. In a sense we create a scapegoat, upon whom we lay all the blame for our own failings or weaknesses. Nietzsche describes it in Genealogy of Morals with an analogy to nature:"

"1670","How can anyone claim to be a Christian while ignoring the very lyrical lessons we were taught as children to love all those who are different from ourselves in color or ethnicity or religion or whatever just as Jesus did? How can we claim to be Christians – the children of Jesus – if we do not follow the lead of Jesus in loving all the people of the world?"
"1671","Remember that announcement of an HD port of Jet Set Radio posted some time ago. I’m not saying it’s dead, but after reading this you might be a bit concerned. Citing financial difficulties in the last fiscal year (which ended last Saturday), Sega has layoff many workers from both its U.S. and European branches and downsizing the company to maintain “sustainable profitability.” In light of this, Sega also mentioned that for these markets, they’ll now focus more on games that are sure-fire his for them including Sonic, Total War, Aliens, and Football Manager. This puts other projects in danger of cancellation or being left to fend for themselves, which include Virtua Fighter 5: Final Showdown, Anarchy Reigns, Yakuza 5, and the aforementioned Jet Set Radio HD port. While Sega did mention that they have cancelled games, all of them so far are unspecified (i.e. never shown to the public). But still, this puts much concern on which projects Sega will give us now as they too are yet another victim of believing Westerners like their guns and football (save for Sonic). And the sad thing about all this: What they believe is right."
"1672","“We know that during REM sleep there is a sharp decrease in levels of norepinephrine, a brain chemical associated with stress. By reprocessing previous emotional experiences in this neuro-chemically safe environment of low norepinephrine during REM sleep, we wake up the next day, and those experiences have been softened in their emotional strength. We feel better about them, we feel we can cope. This study can help explain the mysteries of why these medications help some PTSD patients and their symptoms as well as their sleep. It may also unlock new treatment avenues regarding sleep and mental illness.”"

"1674","It was naturally supposed that the pious and humble monks, who had renounced the world to accomplish the work of their salvation, were the best qualified for the spiritual government of the Christians. The reluctant hermit was torn from his cell, and seated amidst the acclamations of the people, on the episcopal throne: the monasteries of Egypt, of Gaul, and of the East, supplied a regular succession of saints and bishops; and ambition soon discovered the secret road which led to the possession of wealth and honours."

He sat up and fumbled for the flashlight, but before he could reach it, a terrible sound filled the air. It was the howling wail that he had, up until now, only heard echoes of. This time, however, it sounded as though it was only a few feet away. Seth winced at the volume and backed further into the stall. All thoughts of the dream fled his mind as he shouldered the shotgun and turned off the safety. The wail came again, this time coupled by the sound of heavy footsteps outside the bathroom door."

Thank you for your help with our Origin of Your Name home-based project. We will be displaying these projects in the hallway to showcase our baby pictures, as well as to reveal the reason for our given names. This week we will be focusing on the fact that we are all special and we each can do certain things that help form our identity."
"1692","Speculative Japan sometimes reads like a sci-fi literary fanzine in which the editors and regular contributors are just as concerned about themselves and their relationships with each other as they are with the fiction itself, and the essays in Speculative Japan demonstrate a certain geeky fixation on metatextual marginalia. If you happen to be outside of the small circle of authors, translators, and editors who all know each other and worked together on this collection, you might find these essays confusing and off-putting. If you’re already used to the style of the front (and back) material included in SF-themed literary magazines and fanzines, though, you’ll more than likely be able to see past (or even appreciate) the many pages of essays included in Speculative Japan."

Barker, a hugely promising poet when they met, seemed in many ways like the man I’d just split up with. He was unfaithful, penniless, unscrupulous, but he was also hugely encouraging to Smart. I began to think that, perhaps women who put up with men like him and who had always been seen as victims of that type of relationship, weren’t quite the victims they’d been portrayed as. I didn’t think I was a victim, so why see Elizabeth Smart as one? And I started thinking about other literary relationships, especially ones where the women had been viewed as the victims in them. Was that really the whole story?"

Even an empty playground would freak her out to the point of choking herself on her collar, trying to get as far away as possible.

"1758","Really, that’s an exaggeration. My touch of incontinence doesn’t result in the kind of fashionable gushers we’ve recently seen in concert from a certain female singer for the Black Eyed Pees (spelling?). The difficulty I have isn’t the uncontrollable release that wetted Fergie in the midst of all her booming and powing; rather, what I’ve experienced is the drop or two trickle that lies in wait until I’m all zipped up and heading back to my desk. It’s not outwardly noticeable, and I don’t think it’s causing any kind of hazardous spill that could injure or sicken my co-workers. It’s just that warm, then cold, moistness that suddenly shocks your upper thigh and reminds you a little too vividly of what it was like to be young. Very young."

"1788","Web filtering can be configured in two basic ways. It either blocks by category or works with a specific ""allowed"" list. The latter is suitable for very young users that will have a limited number of sites to access so that the list is not difficult to manage. Blocking by category with or without some exceptions is the more common and more flexible way to implement web filtering. It does however have some draw backs. New sites and content are created on the internet by the second and the databases and algorithms used to categorize these sites sometimes struggle to keep up. This means that some sites may get through that shouldn't. The filtering software may catch up after some time, but it is important to monitor internet usage and not rely too heavily on this important but imperfect tool."
"1789","I don’t really have an answer. I’ve heard it said that the atmosphere of French cinema is one of a sort of lazy, baked-in misogyny. But I don’t know if that’s accurate or furthermore if it applies to the directors and time presented in these movies. I do know that outside of this, these movies have some of my favorite actresses of all time doing some of the greatest roles in all of film, so I’d hesitate to lambaste the whole thing as a bunch of dimwitted male interpretations of the emerging concepts of feminism. But at the same time, I think casually saying it’s all fine and okay is also weird."

So we now have a toddler, a baby on the way, 50+ acres of un-navigable mountainside and a 100+ year-old house. Surely not a recipe for disaster, right? But, lest you forget, we are delusional at this point. Deliriously delusional. We are ecstatic about our dream come true. Sure, we’ll take 3 pregnant cows – they’re called heifers – fancy that.

Then we adopted D’Marcus from the shelter. Max’s testosterone kicked in and he decided to show everyone who the alpha male around our house was. He pees on purpose. D’Marcus, on the other hand, pees submissively. If he thinks you’re mad or disappointed with him, he flips over and turns on the spout. So we have to reprimand him in a syrupy sweet quiet voice….”D’Marcus baby, get off the table please. Put the steak down for mommy…good boy.” My son said, “I’m gonna try that. Next time you’re mad at me, I’m just gonna flip over and pee.”"

That was really exciting for me as I felt that there was more I wanted to say, but was holding back a bit because of the reactions of the gatekeepers. I think there will always be people in the industry who are uncertain about taking on certain topics but as writers it is our job to challenge those attitudes and prove that young people will want to read our books, however risky they are."

"1846","Born October 15, 1992, Sam Twiston-Davies was still studying for AS-level exams at school in Gloucestershire, when he had his first Cheltenham Festival winner and Grand National ride as one of racing’s most accomplished amateur riders. The son of trainer Nigel Twiston-Davies and his estranged wife, Cathy, (who both rode as amateurs), Sam was successful in pony racing before starting in point-to-points in the 2008/09 season when becoming eligible at the age of 16. Within a few weeks, on December 28, 2008, he rode his first winner between the flags, taking a race at Cottenham in Cambridgeshire on Grenfell, trained by his mother. At Ludlow on February 18, 2009, he scored his first success under Rules when partnering Baby Run, owned and trained by Nigel, to victory in a hunter chase. A career that was bound to flourish gained added lift through Baby Run, for he and Sam went on to finish third in the following month’s Christie’s Foxhunter Chase at the 2009 Cheltenham Festival and later gained one of the season’s biggest prizes when teaming up for victory in the Champion Hunters’ Chase at the Punchestown Festival. They capped that in March, 2010, when returning to Cheltenham and running out easy winners of the Christie’s Foxhunter Chase. Sam then went to Aintree and partnered Hello Bud into fifth on his John Smith’s Grand National debut. He turned professional shortly afterwards. Sam has a younger brother, 17-year-old Willy, who took over on Baby Run in the 2011 Christie’s Foxhunter Chase, only to be unseated when leading at the second-last fence although he landed the John Smith’s Fox Hunters’ Chase on the horse a few weeks later. Sam partnered Hello Bud to victory in the 2010 Becher Chase over the Grand National course at Aintree in November and that same month gave Little Josh a brilliant ride to land the Grade Three Paddy Power Gold Cup at Cheltenham. He writes a weekly column in the Racing Post every Monday. John Smith’s Grand National record: 2010 Hello Bud (5th); 2011 Hello Bud (PU 29th)"

What astounds me, what has always astounded me, is not that so many people are so certain of their beliefs but that they excoriate people who don’t share them. As a child, I repented for my doubt. Now I embrace it. Religious dogma is not verifiable; science is fallible. Uncertainty is the only belief system I feel sure of."

"1856","Some writers aim to keep their dialogue as realistic as possible, using pauses and dialogue which mimics real speech, almost like a script but this, like everything in writing, has its ups and downs. While it is good to try to write natural-sounding dialogue, fiction is not real life and the purpose of dialogue in a sceneis usually very specific. The trick is to try and balance this. Too realistic can include too much while too contrived can reduce the overall effect of your scene."

We spend a month in preparation and anticipation, looking forward to the big day, Christmas, and all the festivities that go along with it. But then, in the blink of an eye, it’s over and we look forward to the next big thing… New Year’s is just a week away so we don’t have to wait too long for more celebration. But then, just like that, it’s over, and this time there’s nothing but real life to look forward to for the next few months. This is when the post-holiday blues set in because there’s nothing very big for us to hang our hope for happiness on until summer vacation. How do we kick this depression that so many of us slip into during this time of year?"
"1863","However, there is at least some suggestion that Audrey, David and Kylie were operating as a partnership. In the absence of any partnership agreement, this relationship must be analysed within the terms of the Partnership Act 1890. The Act states that a partnership exists merely when persons carry on “a business in common with a view of profit”. A partnership does not need any agreement or other formalities to exist. Ownership of relevant property is a factor in determining the existence of a partnership, but it is not the sole or conclusive factor. It can be argued that even though the freehold in the salon was signed over to David and Kylie, there was an implied licence for the partnership to continue operating out of No 2, so Audrey cannot be locked out. The 1890 Act does contain provisions concerning partnership property. It may be even be possible to argue that the freehold of No 2 is partnership property."

Overall, Void Rays don’t work as well against Zerg, due to the defensive anti-air capabilities of the Zerg Queen. Plus, most Zerg units are small, and hence Protoss ground armies work better. For air superiority, especially against Mutalisk, you’ll want to build a fair number of Phoenix. If you have about 2/3 as many Phoenix as your opponent has Mutalisk, you’ll do well."

As an Executive Assistant I’ve always found it tricky working in an open plan environment for a number of reasons but mainly because of the amount of time I have to spend hiding the confidential documents I am working with while being interrupted yet again by a colleague asking for something! I now work in a secluded corner of my office where I have my own space and rarely have to worry about anyone seeing my work or sneaking up behind me, which is great.

"1923","While at work today, my co-teacher tells me that not only has the landlord fixed the problem under my sink (which actually turned out to be a faulty water heater) but he’s also taken out my recycling for me. Little is said about whether there is still water on the floor, except that I should turn on my ondong floor heating system so that whatever water remains will dry more quickly."
"1924","""Many neurologists either do not accept ME as a neurological condition and/or are poorly informed and usually follow, like GPs, the NICE guidelines. The same point applies to GPs. How can GPs develop personalised plans with us, when they have the same attitudes as neurologists?"" Susan Rogers, Beckenham, Kent; sick for 2 years"
"1925","So today is/was (depending on when you read this) my birthday. There was no excitement no parties and no liquor just me, my mind and my thoughts.

"1928","Many have predicted that 2012 will be a year of slower economy and increased natural disasters. I was also told that the new year would be disastrous for those born under my Chinese zodiac sign. If it’s true, that 2012 will be a struggle as suggested, I hope it’ll still be as fun as the Ammah Hills challenge. Bring it on!"

"1931","Saturday and Sunday"
"1932","The PC’s made their way out the West Trade Road in reasonably good time. There was no rushing really, the mission wasn’t greatly urgent so far as they knew.

"1933","Fill box with cutlery, bowls and cups (not forgetting t'towels, oven gloves, and knife, oh and tin opener... oh and dish sponge)"
"1934","Steven is not the only guest to suffer from panic attacks. I do not normally divulge celebrity secrets but as Mr Gervais has been so unkind to me recently I don't mind saying that on his first TV interview with us Ricky actually soiled himself live on air. I believe you can download this on You Tube. If I say so myself we handled the situation very professionally indeed. Being aware of Ricky Gervais' discomfort, Richard directed the camera towards me and working on pure TV instinct I just started to Irish Dance."
"1935","I will admit that I have let up this year on the usual ""cavalcade of junk"" that makes my family room look like Santa's sleigh threw up....it's a smaller pile this year.

Then, under his direction, the tombstone of O-Kame was shifted, the grave opened, and the coffin raised. And when the coffin-lid had been removed, all present were startled; for O-Kame sat before them with a smile upon her face, seeming as comely as before the time of her sickness; and there was not any sign of death upon her. But when the priest told his assistants to lift the dead woman out of the coffin, the astonishment changed to fear; for the corpse was blood-warm to the touch, and still flexible as in life, notwithstanding the squatting posture in which it had remained so long.

"1941","Consuming foods rich in calcium and magnesium help prevent fluoride intoxication, as they prevent the poison from attaching to the body."
"1942","Stress has a major influence on the function of your immune system, which is why you’ve probably noticed you’re more likely to catch a cold or the flu when you’re under a lot of stress. This is true for both acute stressful episodes, such as preparing a big project for work, and chronic stress, such as relationship troubles or grief. Both will deteriorate your immune system and leave it less able to fight off infectious agents."

"1947","Some wonderful news to share!"
"1948","If you are in a long-term relationship you may feel the pressure to get married, because that’s just what people do when they’ve been together for a while, then you need to stop and ask yourself why? Do you want to get married because that’s what you think is socially expected, or do you want to get married because you love and cherish the person you are with and want your love to be demonstrated through the act of a wedding ceremony?"

"1954","Shall We Dance - this was a pattern I bought from Keepsake Quilting. It was, to me, a very frustrating pattern. I'm sure the pattern was fine and there was just something lost in translation, however every single one of my turtle blocks was not square, and not square in the very same corner. But I was determined to get it finished and see how it turned out - it was sooooo not square and the borders were very wavy but I sent it to Lilly Lucier in Vanceboro, NC for machine quilting and what she did with it was nothing short of a miracle. It's still not square but it's much, much better than it was. I added fun buttons for eyes."
"1955","Do you like the sound of sleigh bells? I think it has something magical and whimsical to it and there is just nothing like the unique soft jingling noise they make. Whenever I hear them I instantly think of a sleigh ride through the mountains in a starry winters night, covered in thick blankets and lots and lots of snow. I can hear the horses stamping and snorting and I can almost feel the wind in my face.....lol yes you can say I really love them :-) I also have them decorated everywhere in my house through winter season. Even though I'm living here in Florida now where there's no snow at all ;-)"

Now on to all the exciting updates of upcoming events for this month."
"1957","My husband can tell you, I’m not a very impulsive person. He is. Sometimes it drives me crazy when he wants to make plans at the last minute. But sometimes it turns out really good. Like the last-minute trip to New York City we took once several years ago when his family lived on the East Coast. We got to see a Broadway play (matinee) and visit some of the touristy"

"1961","In the state leaders meeting of the BRICS just closed in New Delhi, India proposed a series of positive proposals, hoping deepening the relations of the BRICS, strengthening cooperative mechanism of these countries and enlarging the role of the international economy and political life of these countries, which again embodies India’s all-round diplomatic policy. Therefore, it is groundless to think its “Look East Policy” and the American strategy of eastward transfer are converging."
"1962","My observation arises as follows:"

"1964","We headed down to the Riverwalk to eat and see the lights up. There is also a river parade that goes on but we just admired the view from afar. The new LED lights were the talk of the town. It is magical on the riverwalk during Christmas. I highly recommend it. If you are there you may want to stop by the huge tree in front of the Alamo."
"1965","Have a happy Sunday. I know I will, since I will be at home. Just hope I don't wake up earlier than if I had to work."
"1966","to look at maybe I should"
"1967","They dress themselves now you know. And I must admit, relinquishing control on dressing them like dolls was nothing short of excruciating."
"1968","There are thus three important elements in the test for art as articulated by Wilson J.: i) it must not be a disembodied idea but have a method of practical application; ii) it must be a new and inventive method of applying skill and knowledge; and iii) it must have a commercially useful result: Progressive Games, Inc. v. Canada (Commissioner of Patents), 177 F.T.R. 241 (T.D.) at para. 16, aff’d (2000), 9 C.P.R. (4th) 479 (F.C.A.)."
"1969","Why was he arrested in the first place? The British police HATE self-defence"
"1970","Perhaps it is depending on your perspective."
"1971","Initially, it certainly seemed like a pretty pathetic coup, as coups go—young soldiers manning the tanks didn’t look particularly fierce; they looked more…confused. Ditto for the Communist hard-liners, calling themselves an “emergency committee” (those masters of euphemism), who instigated the coup—for perhaps the first time in Soviet history, the Old Guard came off as more ridiculous than sinister. See this “PRI’s The World” feature on the coup."
"1972","So my question is should I just start writing and fill in the research as I go along or should I wait to start writing until I finish my research? Or should I just do nothing?"

"1979","Ahh sweet Friday."
"1980","These are the Sad Facts:"
"1981","I really dislike going to church. I think a lot of it is for show. Some people are honest, but I don’t think its the majority. A lot of preachers teach according to what their own interpretation of the Bible is, which I personally think is stupid. Interpretation of the Bible can go so many ways, yet most of my people seem to go with whatever is said without question. Blind faith makes no sense to me."
"1982","Hello everyone and welcome to our Ninth challenge here at Hookedoncraft and thanks to all who entered our Eighth challenge."

"1987","Me? A leader? Okay, I did prove that there's more to Inside that we knew. That a whole world exists beyond this cube we live in. And finding that led to a major rebellion - between worker scrubs like me and the snobby uppers who rule our world. Make that ruled. Because of me, we're free. I thought that meant I was off the hook, and could go off on my own again - while still touching base with Riley, of course. He's the one upper I think I can trust. But then we learned that there's outside and then there is Outside. And something from Outside wants in."
"1988","In January, I went the whole month without eating meat, I tried again this month but failed miserably."
"1989","There have also been statements made that a toy submarine made of materials at hand in the 1930s with a monster's-head superstructure would be top-heavy and tip over rather than stay afloat. A rather more peculiar problem is that there seems to have been no model he could have copied to look like the 'Sea Monster' in the photo: I have not seen any previous Plesiosaur reconstructions that actually match it. After the image of the photo was established in the imagination of the public, it seemed obvious to say that ""I made a model of how the Loch Ness Monster looked"" but it was not possible to say that before hand!"
"1990","JULIAN SANDS (Boxing Helena)"

"1995","currents of thought that filtered through the universities where he took up"

Mine is most often my stack of crazy quilting blocks because I never seem to be able to finish them. I'm on a mission, though, and those blocks will be finished by the end of this year. If I keep putting it in writing, it will happen. LOL! Have fun while I'm away. Leave that comment now................"
"1997","I don’t know what more to say… I have a lot of projects in my head. I want to start working with new design, modelling, etc. computer programs and improve skills with the old ones. I want to write more technology related stuff. I want to make clothes and start doing accessories. I want to improve my make up skills and make tutorials to help others. I want to live more useful life and write about it."

"2001","""Please stand where you are when I call out your name, and parents,"
"2002","When you are not quite four years old and everyone in your nursery thinks you are weird and avoids you (having gone through the initial period of being impressed with your super powers and came out on the other side) and your only friend is a boy that looks like an albino who the children avoid possibly even more than you, you kinda get the message."
"2003","On Friday, I breakfasted and started to head out for a visit to the Citadel and Roman Theater. I made it outside just in time to experience the first rain of the season. And promptly headed back inside. I love rain. But I don't love clambering about on ruins in the rain."
"2004","HAAAA! I have many more of her that look like this..."
"2005","These little mats are very easy to do, and I like the hand quilting which produces a pretty ruffled effect when they are washed and dried. Thankfully, they also wash and wear well -- a blessing when you've got a battle-scarred table and very little will to wash and iron table cloths. The mats are just pretty enough to distract diners from the tabletop and focus on the plates."
"2006","Big Lettuce to wrap up the turkey"
"2007","A host, of golden daffodils;"
"2008","and show everything to you"
"2009","They always have sources who materialise just in time in an underground parking lot, and hand them big brown envelopes with photos and documents that help them put together that big story just ahead of the newspaper’s deadline. If only life were that simple."

"2012","Silence descended upon them once again, broken only by the sounds of both horses feet upon the dirt path. Brulee’s grip upon the reigns remained tight and she seemed to be holding herself more stiff than before, trying to avoid contact with her. It was many minutes before Creme could muster enough courage to speak again."
"2013","eyes - grey marvy pen"
"2014","That’s the truth … that is the reality of God!"
"2015","I realized I've never shared our laundry room with you, mainly because there's not much to it- it's a small space with just enough room for the washer, dryer, overhead cabinets, and a nice granite sink. I hadn't done anything to make it pretty since moving in and decided this weekend to fix it up. I shopped the house to find a Home Goods mirror ($20), an old potted orchid (Pier One), and some scripture wall plaques that my best friend gave me years ago."
"2016","The characteristic of this Dynamic Architecture is its “green” qualities in that the skyscraper rotates due to it being wind-powered. The project has been looked most closely at in Dubai, the city of the excess and unbelievable. The wind turbines which would be placed between each floor would make the skyscraper an environmentally positive construction, generating a large excess of power to put back into the energy grid. Each turbine has the peak ability to produce around 0.2 megawatt hours of electricity. Given Dubai has an average of 4000 hours of wind annually, with an average wind speed of 16 km/h, the turbines are estimated to produce around 1,200,000 kilowatt-hours of energy per year. Four of the 48 turbines in the building will be enough to power the entire tower, leaving the other 44 to provide surplus energy back into Dubai’s power grid."
"2017","Time preserves everything, but as it does so, it fades things to the colorlessness of ancient photographs fixed on metal plates. Light and time erase the contours and distinctive shading of the faces. One has to angle the image this way and that until it catches the light in a particular way and one can make out the person whose features have been absorbed into the blank surface of the plate. It is the same with our memories. But then one day light strikes from a certain angle and one recaptures a face again."
"2018","Because so many bloggers are wanting to show their appreciation to YOU, this event will be divided into three grade level groups. Each of those smaller events is being coordinated by one amazingly generous, hardworking, incredible blogger (thank you ladies for putting in so much time and effort to get this thing going!!):"

"2020","Here all around you"
"2021","by digby"
"2022","I don't take this as a nice gesture. I take this as kind of undermining me. I was aggravated. I glare at Him thinking He doesn't see me. I find out later He did. After it's all done He makes us all a plate. I am aggravated which makes my appetite disappear. I was looking forward to the chili, so what He made didn't even seem appealing. Plus He made broccoli and I am like a kid I don't like it, so I don't want to eat it. I pick at my stuff never even really getting the plate."
"2023","It is sure to be a fantastic show featuring 28 classic rock tunes including “Don’t Stop Believin’”, “We Built This City”, “The Final Countdown”, “Wanted Dead or Alive”, “Here I Go Again”, “Harden My Heart”, “Can’t Fight this Feeling”, “Renegade” and “I Want To Know What Love Is”."
"2024","From this that He gave them, nothing more than bread and fish, and that He set this equally before all, He taught them moderation, frugality, and that charity by which they should have all things in common.

"2025","Which I'm actually not supposed to eat."
"2026","When you get beyond 16 cores per chip, it becomes very difficult for the chip to function as a parallel processor without the cores being able to communicate with each other, says Lionel Kimerling, a materials science and engineering professor at MIT. “There’s going to be no way to scale performance without some sort of broadcast or near-broadcast capability,” he says."
"2027","On a different note, Trish and I have just fixed our Review of Related Literature for our thesis/senior research paper, whatever it’s called. I’ll be the one to print it. Thanks to the Piso Print, it’ll not cost too much."
"2028","19. Pretentious Assholes - Willow Brook Warriors"
"2029","The Pfaff machine? I could probably dedicate a whole blog to my Pfaff machine. My parents bought it when I started my GCSE Textiles at 14 (yep, I am qualified to make a bag!), and when I left home, they gave the machine to me."

"2031","11/10 - Myrtle Beach, SC - House of Blues"
"2032","As the big songs approach, I realize that I am heartily anticipating this showcase. I want to see them perform! (In Dream High 2 it was more like, ""Well, it's about that time in the episode again. I guess they're going to perform at me, now"".) Pilsook's sweet, heartfelt, and puffy-dressed performance is contrasted with Baekhee's exotic, fierce rendition of the same song. And then, oh noooo, Jinguk shows up on stage with Baekhee."

"2038","But more than this, if you buy the brand of watch that he's prepared to be on a poster for then you too will be as righteous and morally valiant as Geldof is perceived to be. (Let's just ignore his tax evading non-dom status.)"
"2039","I made a mask from one of my photocopies of the bird and attached it firmly with some weak double-sided tape. Using the chisel end of the B63 I added a faint blue around the bird, getting darker closer to the bird. Then, I added larger speckles with the brush end of the B63 and a G12 marker. By airbrushing very lightly from a brush end, you can get larger speckles than if you airbrush directly with the chisel. After I was content, I added a final touch of Opaque white to the eye and beak."

"2042","He doesn't sleep through the night yet, and part of me is glad - that's part of continuing the lacational amenorreah I'm enjoying right now. The other part of me is tired, but not as tired as you might think. I wish I could go back to the time right after Roo was born and tell myself all the tricks!"

I was really excited since I've recently discovered my love for anything green tea. (Green tea ice cream, matcha etc..)

And in working so hard, she lost the pitch a few times. Then Jennifer gave her a rambling and confusing critique about listening to the experts but NOT listening to them when you’re on stage. I know what she meant, but for someone like Hollie who seems to be so cerebral, she’s going to spend too much time trying to follow what Jennifer told her, and not enough time just doing and feeling.

I have to say I’m somewhat annoyed to this day that I never got it back. The 7650 was really the device that triggered the whole idea of convergence and for all the talk of the iPhone’s revolutionary nature, it was in my view the 7650 that got the ball rolling. What was just as surprising as the phone itself were the uses people put it to. It had emerging technologies like Bluetooth and 3G, it offered convenience of a phone and camera in one. More importantly it had the Symbian series 60 OS, so the phone became a software platform you could install applications on either from your computer or wirelessly over the mobile network. I installed a number of them, all with varying degrees of success. Like apps that turn your iPhone into a torch simply by switching on the screen backlight, there was an application which turned your 7650 into a torch by… well you get the idea. There were also precursors to GPS, early attempts to use the cellular network to determine location. One application allowed you to save the network ID of the cell the phone was currently using. You could then set various actions when the phone next connected to that specific cell. For example you set the phone to go to silent mode or switch itself off (e.g. if you worked at a hospital). I used the alarm clock mode which rang when you entered certain network cells. As I travelled to work on the train, I set two alarms, one at my home station cell and one at my work station cell. No matter if the train was delayed or, even god forbid, early I could stay asleep until I reached my destination!"

It’s just that we shouldn’t really be comparing it to other Aussie shows as that’s not exact a tough group to outclass. Laid is a self-assured series that knows the story it wants to tell. Well, that’s one way to look at it. The other way to look at it is: Laid is a smug series that puts on its ‘quirky dark comedy’ skin and doesn’t really do much beyond that. Laid is also not nearly as clever as it thinks it is."

Carrying another child, both inside me and out in the real world, would likely destroy what's left of my back. That's the prevailing reason not to have another child, but I'm having a hard time coming to grips with the fact that the decision isn't really my own. I love Hannah and Max so much, and I know I have more love to give (the financial resources are another matter, but one that I'm sure we'd find a way to overcome). I'm only 33, and I just don't feel done. But I can't avoid the fact that not having another child is what is best for the children I already have, as well as for my marriage, since I'm not sure Marc wants to handle another episode of me being incapacitated with back pain to such a degree."

All of their meals were prepared on the stove top or in an electric skillet that always set out.

(I must confess that as an adult I've ""tried"" those again, just to have that memory, and they AREN'T that great!)

(Ironically, that was my first impulse when I first discovered CCR and learned it was a seasonal. I kept 12 of them stashed in the back of the closet for more than a month!) Now, in my zeal, I immediately sought out the local distributor, the local Total Wine outlet and Deschutes themselves.

Men are people too – we are not inanimate objects. We are not sperm donors and wallets. And if society decides to go in a direction where the traditional roles of men are replaced with government social programs funded by high taxes and deficit spending, then marriage will die in this society."

At Callanish the witches assembled in the center of the stone circle. Their apprentices and servants surrounded them with a ring of fire. This circle of fire they were to tend till the next full moon in October. The witches were to remain in the circle till the threat was gone and they would have one full moon cycle to accomplish their work. On Orkney at the Ring of Brodgar the fire was placed in the center of the circle. The witches danced around the fire. Their dance lasted till the next full moon in October. Many of the witches participating in this Nature work perished as they expended their life forces and cast their spirits to the four elements for it was their will, passion and life force that commanded the elements and drove the storm."

Now I come to think of it, I think I did include a brief clip of the tune from the 'Chop's Bristol show in March in my review of the gig. It's good that the band are continuing to conclude their set with it as it makes a fine end to a perfect evening. Note also how Kurt turns it into a cover of Talking Heads' 'Once In a Lifetime'.

I recently asked for 1 meter and watched as it was measured out and cut before my eyes. Then I got it home and realized that the shop attendant had carefully concealed between pinched fingers the fact that the length was cut right in the middle and TAPED together. I was furious.

Edwin has SSPE, or subacute sclerosing pancephalitis, actually been living with it for the past two years. He was then only 11 years old. SSPE usually occurs at around the age of 9-11 in children who have had measles before the age of 2 or before they had been vaccinated against the disease. It is a rare sequelae of untreated measles but it happened to Edwin. His family lives in a single-room house in one of the most impoverished and least sanitary areas in urban Metro Manila – Payatas."

I knew I could stay happy and in the moment as long as I remembered the loud bellow of this mystical bull walrus. When I saw this film I recognized right away that Manny is the human version of this walrus. Hurtling towards death, frost on his big walrus mustache, howling into the void, Manny even manages a heroic gesture of selflessness before journeying into the final blast of white.

The one big argument against LeBron is the fact that he doesn’t have a ring, but he is only 27 and Jordan didn’t have one yet either. Jordan won his first ring at age 28 and we regard him as the best to ever do it. I’m just saying take some time to appreciate what you’re watching, rather than find ways to criticize it. LeBron should and will go down as one of the best of all-time. He has a lot of time to win numerous championships and score a lot more points. He is one of the most criticized athletes of all-time and still he continues to put up big numbers. James has not yet finished in the playoffs, but he is still great and that sometimes unfortunately gets overlooked. On the other hand, Kobe Bryant deserves all of the accolades he receives. Bryant is a once in a generation type player that has an outstanding resume on the basketball court. It is an honor to watch both of these players play and you can’t go wrong by picking one over the other."

I mean, i look at who we, a country of what 35 million people, i don’t bother looking at statistics unless they’re forced upon me, but say no more than 1/4 of the country actually votes. who are these people, and why do they care? The Conservative Party, the Liberal Party, the NDP, the Green Party, the so called major players, but when it really comes down to it, most canadians get pissed off everytime the word politics come up, everyone has an opinion, yet, nobody really thinks anything they say or do in the matter of politics makes a difference. The only ones who do make a difference are the politicians, because they are so offensive, people, the 3/4 of the population, just don’t give a shit, so, we let them get away with everything short of murder. Corruption is everywhere, we don’t care, the health system has fallen to pieces, going on about cancer, saying tobacco is the leading cause, yet the government, no matter which party, still allows tobacco to be readily available. I just quit smoking, (thank you) but besides the point, if you smoke, you’re going to smoke, and these politicians are always pointing there finger, well, do something about it, they spend billions advertising the negative affects, curing the ones who are affected, cancer, coughs, depression, whatever, but it’s not gonna stop them from smoking, you want to do something about it, make what you call “tobacco” what i call a chemical concoction of who knows what the fuck, fucking ban it, seriously, if it’s that big a deal, fucking ban it, do something about it, stop talking and do something about it. Ok, so i strayed from the actual subject here, Politicians are those people who are all talk and no action, the only action is secretive and damaging, but trying to make everyone happy, nothing every gets done, if they were strong, they’d fucking do something, whether everyone agreed or not.

"2331","But Mélusine is ultimately a character-based book; once they meet, Felix and Mildmay ultimately abandon the main political plot that’s going on. It’s a novel that lives or dies on the strength of its characters, and I just didn’t react to them that strongly. A heartier plot would have helped with this, I think. Felix, poor thing, stumbled for me when he failed to defend his delicately and hardwon status as an aristocrat the very first time someone throws a barb at him about his past, and I never quite bought Mildmay’s cursing. Now, I do like these characters. The true Felix, whom we see only briefly at the beginning and ends of the novel, has a graceful cruelty to him, but he spends much of the novel insane. Just as it distances Felix from the world around him, it distanced me the reader from him as a character. However, Mildmay, who is the much more interesting of the two, lives a full life. The beginning of the novel is chiefly occupied by him being involved in a love story, which I thought would go further. In any case, the Felix and Mildmay relationship is warm and troubled—I refer you to Memory’s various reviews of the novel to express how much."

The neighbor calls the police because she believes she has witnessed Niles killing his wife. Niles, with butcher knife in hand, makes it worse when he tries to hide the whole thing so nothing will upstage his fancy dinner. The actors on that show have the best comedic timing I've ever seen."

"2361","We broke HK$18.4 and the 21 EMA at the same time to the upside, and with relatively modest volatility to boot. We have gotten downside breaks in crisis times, (and look at the carnage it caused!) but this is the first similarly bullish break pattern. Also look at the 63 EMA rejection this week (Wednesday) which would have paid you nearly one Hong Kong Dollar per share intra-day, and two until Friday! The channel drawn near the bottom identifies the up-trend uncertainty, and the up-trend which is slightly below it acts almost as a volatility springboard: the stock can push off, dampen its swing, or if the volatility is high enough, break right through. On the Wednesday trade, the volatility wasn’t high enough to overcome both this line and the 63 EMA, so it looks like it’s going higher instead. Anyway, HK$ 19.5 does not seem far off from the trend post-plunge, and the next question instead comes in around the HK$20-21 levels for more serious profit taking around the summer highs if price breaks HK$19.2."

Much of the time being tough means holding people accountable and making them productive. In many cases, that is a far more severe sanction.Many people don't believe that a probation sentence can be a ""far more severe sanction"" than a prison sentence, but there are many reasons why that can be true. Probation restrictions can be severe, including curfews, bans on drinking alcohol, and regular urinalysis requirements. What's more, probationers must pay significant fees, restitution and treatment costs, perform community service, and at least try to remain employed, which is collectively more than some people who wind up on probation - who may have chaotic, messed up lives to begin with - have ever personally accomplished before."

Each episode of the series shines with this commitment and assurance and it’s a rare thing. Fourteen episodes a year of rigorously written creative television that is really, really different each week is not a mean feat. It’s always fascinating and challenging, whether it’s the Doctor’s insistence on giving any villain a chance to change their ways or the uncomfortable way that he has sometimes dealt with them - it has created splendid debate in my office and, I hope, in the playground too. The depth of life experience too. The horror of and the choices in war, the reality of relying on people, the Doctor and Rose’s friendship - the most platonic relationship ever portrayed.

I believed that and did it for most of the years of my ministry. And I was a good priest, I lived for others and never once betrayed in any real way my vows and my commitment. But now that I am older, I regret some of what I did. I regret that sometimes I was too hard on people! I meant it well, I was sincere, but I think that sometimes I ended up laying added burdens on people when they were already carrying enough pain.

So, there I was sitting at my kitchen table in my still morning garb and unbrushed teeth on a Monday before Wednesday calling the center because (and from what I was told by the operator the Friday before when I first called to inquire for help) the appointments were very limited to a first call, first answered basis, and the operator suggested it best I call early-as in fifteen minutes early prior to the phone lines opening up-and by chance my call had been answered, and I was set up for an appointment which is now today. I'm nervous, in part because I was informed by the operator that just because one garnishes an appointment for financial help, didn't necessarily guarantee financial help; so I had my fingers tightly crossed.

All those people now having to pay for an exemption really adds up. Not only do they have to pay now but if their child is young, then they have to pay AGAIN when that child reaches grade 7. Next they’ll put in place a new bill making them return for another exemption for high school and it could go on like this. It’s obvious why they are doing this and it’s a very simple reasoning. Doctors are losing money and fast. Many people do not realize how many well baby appointments are recommended, all occurring when a vaccination is due. Not only are they paid for the visit but they make money on each vaccine given as well. If more people are not getting vaccinated and therefore not needing to go for well baby visits, then doctors are not receiving that money anymore. This new bill will ensure that, that money lost is partially made up, while also hoping that parents will crumble and give in to vaccines."

At the top of his lungs, to a small crowd of disappointed and bewildered family, he said, ""Horse C~~k!"". That's right, ""horse"", then the word archaically used to refer to a male chicken. He turned around so that everyone could hear him repeat it five or six times, ""Horse C~~k! Horse C~~k! Horse C~~k!"".

To this day I am not sure what that point was, but whatever it was, he got it all out on that sunny 4th of July so many years ago."

Oh well, they are still really darn good and the next time we make green chili, I am storing away some extra just for this purpose.

"2717","Povitica, pronounced ‘po-va-teet-sa’ is traditional Eastern European dessert bread that is traditionally served during the holiday season. It is also known as Nutroll, Potica, Kalachi or Strudia. It is a heavy sweet bread that requires quite a bit of time, skill and patience to make, meaning they often sell for extortionate amounts. Povitica is quite unique and unlike any other kind of bread I’ve ever come across. It looks a little rustic on the outside, but once sliced, reveals the most amazing swirls of thin dough interlaced with sweet sticky filling. I love how its not even just one swirl, but two or three individual swirls in each slice. It really is quite extraordinary, a real show stopper!"

"2733","I recently came across an article in Time Business by Margaret Heffernan that shared the secrets of people who are very productive. I was a little surprised at a couple of the habits so I thought I would share them with you. According to the article it boils down to four things. 1 – These people have a life. The article suggests academic research keeps showing external commitments are highly correlated with high achievement. 2 – They take breaks. From what I understand when you get tired you can quickly become rigid and narrow-minded and a quick break may be all that is needed to get those creative, productive juices going again (more on that later). 3 – These people have often worked in different industries. While this makes sense to me I was surprised to see it on the list. Having a diverse background allows you to see different frameworks and approaches. We discussed this in the Diversity Enhances Productivity post from November 2011. 4 – The final attribute – these people have great outside collaborators and networks. What the article really suggests is productive people have very wide, rich resources to call on. The secret to productivity isn’t the latest tool or being better organized, it’s having a complete life."

"2757","And SDO has also been found to predict the tendency to express racial preferences (e.g. Heaven & St. Quintin, 2003). So let's look at what the other half of the items in the SDO scale say: They say things like: ""Inferior groups should stay in their place"", ""Superior groups should dominate inferior groups"" and ""Some groups of people are just more worthy than others"". So people who believe that there are inferior and superior groups also believe that there are inferior and inferior races. How astounding! Since races are groups, the finding that the SDO scale predicts racism is in fact LOGICALLY ENTAILED. It parades as an empirical finding but it is not. It tells us nothing new about the world. It is merely something that is true by definition. What a fraud!"

"2766","This picture holds so much inspiration for me. I can just see myself and a dear friend sitting in a beautiful room catching up on our lives. To create my card I used the Papertrey Ink set ""Simply Jane"". I wanted to capture the design, and colors of the area rug, and I thought the Simply Jane frame would be perfect. I sponged the die cut frame with Latte pigment ink from A Muse Studio. Next I stamped the matching ornate frame image using Crumb Cake ink from Stampin Up. In the picture there are very light touches of pink, dark, and light, and I think I captured that in my floral bouquet with the matching stamped bow. I used two shades of pink from A Muse Studio, Bubblegum, and Shell. The delicate color shading was created using an eye shadow applicator. Love how that turned out! I used the PTI Linen/Canvas impression plate to add subtle texture to the back ground. I LOVE the way my card turned out, and I kinda hope you like it to. =0) Have a wonderful day!"

"2770","It serves a grand purpose of course, for the people will utterly never support thuggery, decent families and individuals recoil from such behaviours and this will be eternal certainly the common man has changed, Hollywood and Judaic chicanery has seen to that, today the hero is akin to the criminal and is no longer a knight but a coarse, antagonistic, foul-mouthed gun touting thug, therefore the body-politic has become desensitised and indeed society as a whole has and is becoming evermore violent. So it may come to pass that the thug of today will be mild in comparison with the common man of tomorrow, such a concept although abhorrent is not beyond the realms of possibility. Yet the thug offers for many ironically a perverse sense of protection, protection should one follow their worldview, their creed, indeed, should one side with the yob then one is able with strength of numbers to impress upon even more people ones own particular stance, or position, yet it is never the thug who manipulates opinion but the choirmaster who leads the orchestra."

The team never gave up, they still practiced even though they lost the financial support from our government, they still toiled under the punishing sun every day; to show that this setback will not hamper their dream of bagging as much medals and awards as they can on the coming competition and bring national glory for the Philippines. Surprisingly, the government was not yet through with the team. Shortly after the fiasco became known to the people, some officials released a statement that the accuses some of the team members of using steroids, they also said that some of the members are too old for competition and should be replaced. Wow, steroids really? How can they afford steroids when some of the athletes can barely buy food and vitamin supplements for their children. Too old? If that’s really the case then they should try aspirants out for the team and replace those ‘old’ athletes with new members that has proven themselves, why strip the team of the its national team status? I don’t know the real reason why this happened, I just know that this sucks. That’s why I am very thankful and grateful for the people who helped the team after the government let go of them.

"2814","Only it's not. Not by a mile. Dawkins NEVER says things science can't explain don't exist. Ever. This is not the last time Chopra comes off looking like he didn't even read the book. He goes on about how the sainted Einstein believed in God (he didn't, and Dawkins went to some effort to point that out), he continually said that Dawkins said the universe was created by random chance (wrong again), and even referred to one of the analogies Dawkins debunked (the 747 put together by a hurricane) to support his arguments about the non-random nature of the universe. Sheesh. This guy calls himself a doctor? He also obviously woefully misunderstands quantum physics, and mistakes Dawkins for some sort of 19th century objective materialist who subscribes only to the narrowest interpretations of Newtonian physics. Of course, this is all crazily off-base. And his coup de grace? His way of knowing there is a God? Because consciousness transcends matter. We can think thoughts with our mind, which has to be more than just the chemicals it's made of. Well doesn't it? He even petulantly asks, ""Do you think you are conscious and intelligent, or are you being fooled by random chemical reactions inside your skull?"""

Murphy’s Encyclopedia of Murder and Mystery for instance. This is probably because most of her output was devoted either to screenwriting or in the science fiction genre. She did however write five crime novels and those in the know, like Bill Pronzini in 1001 Midnights, consider The Tiger Among Us to be the best of her few excursions into the genre. It is a story of vigilantes or juvenile delinquency; or both; or neither, depending on your point of view. The protagonist, Walter Sherrin, is a shining poster boy for 1950s Eisenhower America: he’s white, middle class, has a nice little home in the Ohio suburb of Mall’s Ford, a car that is nearly paid for, is married to a very pretty wife he loves and they are rearing two young children. But the seeming comfort of this conformity is soon to be shattered when, working late and heading out to buy coffee, he is set upon by a gang of teenagers. Badly beaten, he spends nine days in a coma and only just pulls through. When he awakens, his sense of self slowly begins to erode. No one has been caught and he never even got a good look at the boys that assaulted him, though he knows that the ring leader was called ‘Chuck’. Beyond that, he finds his private life in a real mess. His wife has left the city after receiving a threatening message from the gang. Is this enough to solve my case of reader’s block, you may ask?"

"2879","There is a growing fascination today with angels. These men were angels and they were dressed in white apparel. Who were they? They were messengers from God, angels. Who are angels? What is their sex? Every time we find angels mentioned in the Bible, they are men, never women. They were men who came to visit Abraham. They were men who came to report to God in Job chapter one. They were called the “sons of God.” Even the fallen angels mentioned in Genesis 6 were called the “sons of God.” Today you find that angels are always women. Why? Because they are not the holy angels sent from God but the fallen angels, those who followed and still follow Satan in his deceptive activity. God is not the author of confusion but Satan uses confusion all the time."

"2937","THE conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of the masses is an important element in democratic society. Those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government which is the true ruling power of our country. We are governed, our minds are molded, our tastes formed, our ideas suggested, largely by men we have never heard of. This is a logical result of the way in which our democratic society is organized. Vast numbers of human beings must cooperate in this manner if they are to live together as a smoothly functioning society. Our invisible governors are, in many cases, unaware of the identity of their fellow members in the inner cabinet. They govern us by their qualities of natural leadership, their ability to supply needed ideas and by their key position in the social structure. Whatever attitude one chooses to take toward this condition, it remains a fact that in almost every act of our daily lives, whether in the sphere of politics or business, in our social conduct or our ethical thinking, we are dominated by the relatively small number of persons—a trifling fraction of our hundred and twenty million—who understand the mental processes and social patterns of the masses. It is they who pull the wires which control the public mind, who harness old social forces and contrive new ways to bind and guide the world. It is not usually realized how necessary these invisible governors are to the orderly functioning of our group life. In theory, every citizen may vote for whom he pleases. Our Constitution does not envisage political parties as part of the mechanism of government, and its framers seem not to have pictured to themselves the existence in our national politics of anything like the modern political machine. But the American voters soon found that without organization and direction their individual votes, cast, perhaps, for dozens or hundreds of candidates, would produce nothing but confusion. Invisible government, in the shape of rudimentary political parties, arose almost overnight. Ever since then we have agreed, for the sake of simplicity and practicality, that party machines should narrow down the field of choice to two candidates, or at most three or four. In theory, every citizen makes up his mind on public questions and matters of private conduct. In practice, if all men had to study for themselves the abstruse economic, political, and ethical data involved in every question, they would find it impossible to come to a conclusion about anything. We have voluntarily agreed to let an invisible government sift the data and high-spot the outstanding issues so that our field of choice shall be narrowed to practical proportions. From our leaders and the media they use to reach the public, we accept the evidence and the demarcation of issues bearing upon public questions; from some ethical teacher, be it a minister, a favorite essayist, or merely prevailing opinion, we accept a standardized code of social conduct to which we conform most of the time. In theory, everybody buys the best and cheapest commodities offered him on the market. In practice, if every one went around pricing, and chemically testing before purchasing, the dozens of soaps or fabrics or brands of bread which are for sale, economic life would become hopelessly jammed. To avoid such confusion, society consents to have its choice narrowed to ideas and objects brought to its attention through propaganda of all kinds. There is consequently a vast and continuous effort going on to capture our minds in the interest of some policy or commodity or idea. It might be better to have, instead of propaganda and special pleading, committees of wise men who would choose our rulers, dictate our conduct, private and public, and decide upon the best types of clothes for us to wear and the best kinds of food for us to eat. But we have chosen the opposite method, that of open competition. We must find a way to make free competition function with reasonable smoothness. To achieve this society has consented to permit free competition to be organized by leadership and propaganda. Some of the phenomena of this process are criticized—the manipulation of news, the inflation of personality, and the general ballyhoo by which politicians and commercial products and social ideas are brought to the consciousness of the masses. The instruments by which public opinion is organized and focused may be misused. But such organization and focusing are necessary to orderly life. As civilization has become more complex, and as the need for invisible government has been increas ingly demonstrated, the technical means have been invented and developed by which opinion may be regimented. With the printing press and the newspaper, the railroad, the telephone, telegraph, radio and airplanes, ideas can be spread rapidly and even instantaneously over the whole of America. H. G. Wells senses the vast potentialities of these inventions when he writes in the New York Times:"

"2974","Though a previous release showed voters were slightly happy with the results of the recent Wisconsin recall elections, that was because Republicans were more happy that they did not lose control of the Senate than Democrats were unhappy that they did not gain a third seat. By a one-point margin (48-47), Wisconsinites would actually prefer that Democrats control that body. Most of that is because Democrats have a three-point identification advantage in the state, as Republicans seem to now be a tad more enthusiastic about maintaining their majority than Democrats are wanting their party in charge, and independents split 43-42 for the GOP."

Kathryn Jean Lopez, the voluble in-house defender of the “religious liberty” being trampled upon by President Obama, equates the morning-after pill with “abortion coverage for all” — never mind that said pill cannot terminate a pregnancy but only may prevent implantation a fertilized egg. (The “personhood” troops in Mississippi love Lopez.) In the same column, discussing Paul Ryan’s proposed budget, Lopez refers to the “left-wing Catholics opposing the Ryan plan,” conveniently turning the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops — which explicitly states that it “represent[s] all of the U.S. bishops on key issues at the national level” — into a bunch of socialists. Strangely, the ultra-religious Lopez exists quite happily alongside writers like Mark Steyn, who titles his latest column about the Secret Service prostitution scandal “Grope and Change” and writes:"

"3031","From there, Nav and I walked over the SIFF Uptown theater in Queen Anne, where the night’s screenings would take place. At night’s end, I don’t think I’ve ever been as excited about filmmaking as I was at that moment. The caliber of films screened Friday night was mind blowing. Not only were some films as high quality as professional done indie films and Hollywood productions, but the story concepts were fun, original, and creative. I spent the night running between the two screening theater rooms trying to see as many of the night’s films as possible. The categories of the films I got to see that night were: Keep it Cinematic; Sex, Lies & Angst; Late Night Comedy; and Late Night Horror. There’s not enough time or space on here to really delve into what were my favorites from each category and why. But what I can go on about is how much tonight and all of NFFTY is one incredible learning experience. One, I’m getting to watch all these amazing films and hear about the processes the filmmakers went through to make them during the Q&A sessions; and two, watching these films, I am connecting and bringing together all of the things I have been learning over the past two quarters as a CineMedia major. My experiences in acting classes, screenwriting classes, directing seminars all come into play as I watch these showcases of youth talent. As I watch a film, I can’t help but automatically analyze it for what is working and what isn’t in it. I have Andrew Tsao’s voice in one ear speaking about dramatic narrative and acting, and in my other ear I have Shawn Wong’s voice speaking about element’s of screenwriting and dialogue. Watching these films was such a learning experience for me for when I want to go and make my own stuff. For example, within one film, I can be watching and think, wow this is an incredible scene, and know why it’s incredible, why it’s working and what the filmmaker was thinking when he/she was creating it, because of the tools I have gained from CineMedia. Similarly, within that same film, I will watch a scene and think, mmmm this scene isn’t working exactly right, something’s off, and I’ll know why it’s not working because of the skills I’ve gained from CineMedia. Each film had moments of pure awesome glory as well as moments that just missed the mark. And each one taught me something different or left me with a different take away that I could apply to my future film projects."

It is small and the only one present so they are not too worried. The past tutors that they zapped with the gamma knife have almost completely disappeared (they take a while to break down) so the doctors are feeling pretty good about being able to treat this one the same way with similar results. They want to wait six weeks and then do another MRI to see if more show up and to see how fast the tumors are growing. So we wait. We grapple with the fact that Elisa is no longer ""cancer free"", which really she never can be. The reality of this new ever-shifting planet we live on takes a while to get used to. She keeps up with her chemo while we wait, and we try not to worry about the next MRI."

I exercise after that – either the elliptical trainer with an eBook or head out to my garden or ride my bike – depending on the weather and the time of year because the sun's as lazy as I am in the wintertime. I get busy on whatever my project du-jour is, usually by about 10 a.m. I whip back and forth during the day at intervals to do some things for the business part of being a writer, which I sometimes enjoy way too much, especially when I'm having a hard time deciding which way to go with a story. I try to tie things up by about 5 so I can get dinner going, but some days if I'm on a roll, my wonderful husband eats cereal or leftovers and never even complains about it. I do quit for a few hours of family time at night, even when I've got an impending deadline. By 9 p.m., I'm usually getting ready for bed and read for an hour or so. But often it's hard turning my brain off long enough to sleep. When the muse can't be silenced, my office light comes back on at about 2 a.m. Some of my best work is done then. Or at least it seems that way when I'm writing it. When I look at it again after I've had some sleep, I often realize I'm not as clever as I thought I was. On days my husband travels – which he does quite often – I rarely know what time it is and may never get out of my pajamas!"

The movie may suffer more from this malady than the book does, as with a running time of just over two hours, some of the tertiary characters – even some of the secondary characters – get short shrift. If you can’t tell the prospective culprits apart, how invested can you get in the hunt for the mole?"

I am the man at the wedding who scampers to the bar like a squirrel when a danceable song comes on. Don’t get me wrong – I like the skill and I try hard. I have danced convincingly in a half-dozen musicals without fatalities. And when I have a patient and excellent choreographer like Lughnasa’s Vanessa Terzaghi, I’ll give it everything I’ve got. But through the years, as I’ve tended to leave musical theatre to those much more talented than myself, the dancing tool has become neglected. And learning that choreography has become a bit painful, because it’s a language I’ve forgotten how to speak. At times during our process I’ve wondered why playwright Brian Friel used the dance metaphor so pervasively. And why on earth did the apparently-sane director Craig Mummey cast me as the dance-mad Welshman Gerry Evans? Surely we can say our lines and the words will carry us, right? None of this falling asleep with nightmares of step patterns and tempo progressions in my head."

"3141","I’ll end with this. “Lord of Misrule” was a gift, and though the book wasn’t awesome, it kept my attention, got me thinking, and was generally a good read. You don’t always hit a bulls-eye when you give a book as a gift, so it is a risk. I believe it is always a risk worth taking. If you read a book jacket and you think for a even just a moment about whether a friend may like the book, then through that simple act you are demonstrating you are a good friend."
"3142","So this flick was directed by a guy called Chris Gorak, he’d directed only one other film before and it was another post-apocalyptic film called Right At Your Door (2006) which I started watching once but had no time to continue. I will try and re-watch it again soon, especially since I’m on a post apocalyptic kick these days. Thing about Mr. Gorak is that he’s worked with a lot of famous directors like Terry Gilliam and David Fincher, but on a technical level; as art director and production designer. Gorak has done all sorts of jobs in all kinds of films and well; I guess he decided to put all that experience to good use directing his own film. With The Darkest Hour he finally got his chance to direct a theatrical release, unfortunately, in my opinion, Mr. Gorak still has a ways to go in terms of learning what makes a good film work. Making things believable even within your fantastical context is a good way to start. Also, trying to go for a bit more originality. As it is this feels like a low budget version of Independence Day. I can watch aliens falling from the sky, but if you show it in a believable fashion I’ll believe it. That’s the magic and illusion of movies anyways, making us believe the unbelievable. But if you give me these cheesy looking aliens, then your movie goes down a couple of notches, sorry dude!"

Let’s simply look at how WoW gives any individual player their perception of progress as they continue to play the game. The players’ perceived progress is the beating heart of the MMO experience. No matter what walk of WoW life you’re in, you log in hoping to add something to your character sheet before you log out again, something tangible when you log in the next time.

That illustrates how POD is getting cheaper as time and technology move forward. The consumer will see our books at around the same price as any traditional book and we can set the discount price too. As for e-books, the pricing will be much lower than the paperback because it’s cheaper (almost nil) to create (shame on publishers who charge the same price as the paperback) and we can still make a decent profit. With Lightning, the cost that would normally go to wholesale and distribution is absorbed into printing POD and because there is no wholesale, the books can stay around the same price."

A great scene in the movie is where the crew takes the train out to the hills, and instead of being happy with being out of the city, they are all pissed off because there's nothing to do there.

As he came back over to get back in the car I blindfolded him and sat him down in the passenger’s seat. We drove around for about 10 minutes so he wouldn’t know where we were going. We ended up at his parent’s house. Unfortunately, I underestimated Preston’s ability to keep a secret because as soon as we drove up he yelled, “Mimi! Grandpa!” Spencer laughed and said, “Why did he just say Mimi and Grandpa?” and I just pretended like I didn’t hear either of them."

My eyes freaked out yet again a few weeks ago, one eye was blurry. It's frustrating because I really was being careful, taking my contacts off as soon as I got home from work and wearing my glasses on weekends. The doctor said it was an inflamed cornea, and we'd talk about contacts once it's better. I got gel to keep it from scaring, which I applied dutifully, since a scar on my eye sounds like some serious business."

"3242","Tomorrow evening, Jews around the world gather to retell and celebrate the Exodus. At some seder tables, undoubtedly, there will be some allusion to the sufferings inflicted on the Palestinian people, in our name. But I don’t think that can suffice. Our hopes and efforts really imply a new Exodus, out from the Occupation mentality, the Mitzrayim, that justifies such cruelty and the doing to others what we ourselves have found so hateful that we have retold its story for thousands of years. I spoke of Jewish activism as –educative– from the Latin to lead out. I see Jewish activism here and in Israel as leading out from the idea of tikkun olam toward a new evolution of Jewish consciousness, not only against the Occupation but in solidarity with all who are trying to liberate themselves. Let’s not deceive ourselves: this is not a simple or straightforward movement. It’s a long sojourn in a different kind of desert, a sojourn to be shared with others, and I believe the people of Jewish Voice for Peace are part of its reality."

So i took it apart and did that instead. I would have preferred not to add those little rose matte glass beads, but the beading wire wouldn't fit back through the itty bitty holes in the itty bitty garnets and I couldn't find anything more suitable to finish the ends off with. I do have an electric bead reamer but I was afraid the garnets would break if I tried to make the holes bigger. I think it's all right like that. (Brass leaf medallion from Happy Mango Beads.)"

"3259","On the paths through the gardens we sheet mulched, which means we covered the ground with cardboard and then covered that with wood chips to prevent weeds and grass from growing. This is a great way to keep weeds out of your garden. If you garden, you know weeds can quickly spread from a weedy to a non-weedy area, so if we completely weed out an entire yard or garden, it will be way more difficult for the weeds to get into your garden beds. It also just looks better to have clearly visible, neat and weedless paths going through your beds. It was a lot of work weeding out all that grass and shoveling all those wood chips…but it will be so worth it down the road when we don’t have to weed so often! Plus it’s a great workout. We joke at the garden that if you garden you don’t need to buy a gym membership. And it’s a great way to work on your tan."

"3261","Ōtsuka’s “World and Variation,” originally published in 1989, is ostensibly about Bikkuriman Chocolates, or, more specifically, about the trading cards packaged with the chocolates. It was because of the trading cards that the chocolates were such a phenomenal hit with children around the time that Ōtsuka was writing, even though the character “Bikkuriman” had no television or manga tie-in products. The secret to Bikkuriman’s success was that, on the back of each trading card, there was a short paragraph of information about the character depicted on the front. If a child collected enough cards, he would gradually be able to piece together a larger story and gain a broader perspective on the Bikkuriman universe."

I had a friend of mine explain life like a fork. At some points its like things just make sense and you have these tuning fork moments where you’re like aw, this is what I’m supposed to do. You don’t have those a lot but as you get older and you look back it all starts making sense and you realize that’s kinda your path. I feel like music has been that way. There was a time that where it was purely just what I did for enjoyment. I would play for friends at a party. I started playing in bars for crowds of 50 people. I played for my students at school. It felt right. My goal was just to be able to make a living doing it so I expected to be touring about three hours from home and playing for a few hundred people every night and the next thing I knew I was playing for thousands of people and now I’m touring all over the country."

"3288","Middlesex Street, 'Petticoat Lane', is full of public housing, from interwar tenements to a remarkable mini-Barbican of walkways and towers. It's a sudden plunge right into real London, and vies with Poplar for the sharpest meeting of rich and poor in Europe. These places were largely owned by the LCC, now Tower Hamlets, and hence are left to rot. The City's own postwar housing projects, however, are still a revelation. It's incredible at this distance to think that the City could have paid for Golden Lane, for instance, a place where evidently some of London's working class manage to live well next to architects who are paying over the odds for the same flats. The Barbican, into which it imperceptibly fades along Goswell Lane, is a more complicated proposition, never public housing in the strict sense, although certainly not intended as the luxury enclave it is now. The Barbican, aside from the sheer pleasure of its Brutalist-Baroque grandeur, is mainly of use for deflecting every anti-modernist, anti-urban shibboleth going – a high density arrangement of towers and walkways, without an inch of 'defensible space', in beefy raw concrete, that is doing very well thank you (it's also, like the City itself, a wonderful place to get yourself deliberately lost on a Sunday)."

Right now we need an understanding and resolution to the problem at hand. Should you, or should you not, reveal all the relevant data when it is yet to be published. You want to share all your data with the peers, but you also don’t want to risk the full ownership of your work. You don’t want others to take your ideas and publish before you do, but you also come to the meeting with the hope that you will gain from others’ ideas/comments about your work. The concern is even more acute when you, like me, come from a developing country where implementing the ideas can be slow, for a variety of reasons. I have heard people talking about sending an abstract to a meeting only when the manuscript is ready to be submitted. Is this the best we can come up with? What about the data that is exciting but has not become a full story? Should you present a new method or a new transgenic animal you invented but you don’t know what to do with it? What if you had wonderful beginning in a project, but you are not able to take it to the end point? Is it alright if others can take ideas from your work and take it to conclusion – after all this will help science and the society?"

Oh, I forgot to tell you this. Yesterday I took a lesson from Meagan. It was at someone's house and only a couple of dogs. Miley only circled one time. WhooHoo , I was so excited. Now back to class. It was our turn to run. There was a dogwalk, tunnel discrimination and Miley took the wrong one. So I brought her back to try again and circling started. It lasted at least 3 minutes. I just stood there waiting her out( feeling bad about wasting every ones time). She just kept circling with no change is speed. It felt like forever. She has never lasted this long without stopping. She finally stops. Im not sure how to reward. Give her treats or start running agility again. I chose to run. Then she jumps the DW contact. I stop. She circles. But this time it lasted about 1/2 the time then the first circling event. I did reward with food this time. People commented that they have never seen her do this. They probably just hadnt seen it to this extent. I normally would have called her to my side to break the circling so thats why they didnt realize how big a problem this is for me. But she needs to chose not to do this without me calling her."

Patterned after English abolitionist groups, the society soon became far more radical. Most of the future Jacobin leaders such as Lafayette, Condorcet, Mirabeau and Robbespierre were members, and chapters soon spread throughout France. San Domingo was subject to French rule, and colonists began to wonder how far these zealots would take their slogan “Liberty, Equality, Fraternity.”In the words of Mirabeau, whites “slept on the edge of Vesuvius”"

I think it will become ever more difficult for popular modernists to claim the support of Vatican II for their outlandish opposition to the magisterium. The Catholic blogosphere has been one influence prompting students to look at the texts themselves."

Only by forcing our brains to recategorize information and move beyond our habitual thinking patterns can we begin to imagine truly novel alternatives. It also helps us to get less atrophy of the brain and can stimulate intelligence, loosen our mind and keep senior moments away (always a plus)."

"3352","Long after his death Isaac Newton’s unpublished papers finally revealed a hidden obsession with alchemy. Newton was interested in particular with the Philosopher’s Stone, a proto-scientific cum mystical experiment reputed to transmutate one material into another. The Crown feared that the alchemists would devalue the coinage if they did one day manage to make gold coins out of lead. Newton, as Warden and Master of the Royal Mint, kept his alchemist musings to himself. Those who did not risked imprisonment and the hangman’s noose. The Crown knew then what many businesses are about to learn: even gold looses its value if it can be easily reproduced. This is precisely what is about to happen as a result of 3D printing."

"3362","With Easter weekend around the corner I have began to think about the meaning of Easter. Some people associate Easter with bunnies, colorful eggs, baby chickens; in other words the celebration of spring. As great as those epic Easter egg hunts were growing up, Easter is about death and then life. It is strange that I mentioned death before life. However, as a result of Adam and Eve’s disobedience, that brought the human race into sin, we are condemned to eternal death (i.e. Hell). I’m sure nobody wants eternal death, right? I’m sure we would flock to a solution that does not involve us dying. But the reality is Sin demands death, so somebody has to die. Now imagine this:"

Furthermore, you run the risk of making your game ‘formulaic’ in the sense that PCs always know what to expect all the time. Medium Fish campaigns don’t always require the GM or players to think outside the box (we beat up the henchmen, we outwit/outlast/outnumber the big villain, we go home and party!). They are often great fun, granted, but they can get old after a while."

Well, my wife picked me up a bomber of it the other day and I had it this past weekend. I decided I really liked it! It seemed nicely hopped and good bitterness to it.

She opened the map, hoping to locate the place: she felt comforted, absorbing herself in something so normal. She soon found the road on the map: a red line heading towards a strip of blue, a lake between hills. Once they got into the hills they hadn’t got a lot further to go to get to the house. What would they do when they arrived? She craved normality: talking to friends about books, music, films, politics. She was looking forward to the mysterious pleasure one can feel inhabiting an unfamiliar place. The usual associations with the immediate past are temporarily erased.

And let me note, yesterday when I was at the gym this chick was there with her boyfriend and she was lifting the maximum amount of weight she could on everything!

It was a tense game, the fact that two of the goals were down to mistakes said it all. The plot reminded me of the 1986 final with Everton dominating at the start but not making it count, allowing us back into it to eventually take over and finish as the stronger side. The result, until Andy Carroll’s back header in the 87th minute, was always in doubt and the singing of “You’ll Never Walk Alone” was a song of relief as well as celebration."

It was the powerful, loving connection I share with my surviving daughters that enabled me to stay strong, endure, and survive. Once I had that figured out, I gained a much better understanding of myself. For thirty+ years I continually strived to be a good mother. You see, giving your baby away destroys your self-worth. However, I am pleased to say I no longer crave to be the “mother of all mothers.” I now happily realize that in the eyes of my daughters, I am!"

You can’t expect a person to act responsibly unless they’re given responsibility, after all. To start with we had a few hiccups, where he’d wander into the park and roam around there for half an hour, sending me into a spin because I’d be scared he’d got lost, but once I decided to allow him to take Poppy for walk in the park, too, that stopped. Clearly he just wanted to be able to go in the park alone. I should probably mention that the garage is no more than 200 yards from our house and that the park is at the end of our street, so even closer."

"3551","N- inserts next, a reminder that this supposed ‘truth’ that people seem to pursue so doggedly, might be dangerous. ‘Nobody is very likely to consider a doctrine true merely because it makes people happy…But people like to forget that making unhappy…is no counterargument. Something might be true while being harmful and dangerous…Indeed it might be a basic characteristic of existence that those who would know it completely would perish…’ This argument again tries to drive home the point that ‘truth worship’ is not likely an end in itself. N- asks the dogmatist, “Would you still want the truth if possession of it ended your life?” Short of this, he remarks, ‘In which case the strength of a spirit should be measured according to how much of the “truth” one could still barely endure…to what degree one would require it to be thinned down, shrouded, sweetened, blunted, falsified.’ N- says, if you want to say you value truth above all, you have to value truth above life, and he sees this as an absurd position, and points out that the best position a dogmatist (who relishes not an obscure martyrdom) is figuring out how best to lie; how to give the ‘best falsification’, in which case they ‘descend’ into the realm of argument and interpretation with the rest of us.

Steve and I just turn to each other in wonderment whenever anyone would even think of wanting to do what we do every day. I guess it’s the grass is greener meets the photos that we post on the blog. No-one likes to portray the bad things about their lives and so we tend not to post anything depressing or sordid that might perhaps make someone think differently about us. My dad died on July 7th 2010 leaving us more aware of our mortality and suddenly able to call a few acres of land “mine”. “You lucky bastard!” (Said in Michael Palin’s voice from “The Life of Brian”…) and here it is if you are the poorer for never having discovered Monty Python so far… http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EI7p2p1QJI Yes…we ARE lucky and we will always be grateful to my dad for giving us something that we would never have had otherwise but right there is where the scene of happiness and joy starts to fade into reality and hard work. Nothing that is worth having is easy people! We tend to look to the future to deliver us from our lives today and some of us spend our lives waiting for “the kids to leave home”, “retirement”, “that winning lotto coupon” rather than taking stock of what life has actually dealt us and learning to not only accept and live with it but find real happiness in our own personal circumstances. How many of you have watched documentaries about native tribes out in the middle of the South American jungle who despite their lack of anything that we would be able to identify as “wealth” are all smiling, curious and most happy members of the human race with the strongest whitest teeth I have ever seen. I wonder how people living a subsistence life can be so very happy? Is it because they are living close to the earth that feeds clothes and sustains them and they have discovered their niche within this endless ancient balance of cycles. They are living how we all should live. Simply, with few needs and it’s only when you start introducing societies “wealth” that problems start to occur. I dare say I am glossing over the squabbles, the human vices and the general need that we humans have to stuff up whatever we are given that would be present wherever 2 or more people group together to coexist, but in general they would deal with it themselves and they would be very aware of the consequences of their actions. I find it laughable that we in 1st world societies have so much and are always hungry for more when these simple people are very content with their lot. Serendipity Farm is our chance to make a difference to our own little plot of earth and see if we can’t leave it better than when we arrived on it just under 2 years ago. The process of change that we are taking and where we found out how to go about changing for the better is what this blog is all about. I am trying to be as honest as I can about our lives but am as guilty of the next person in omitting some of the more nefarious things or glossing over them with humour. Life is tough enough without being constantly faced by negativity and so I try to temper reality with humour as often as I can."

Daniel Johnnes, Wine Director for The Dinex Group, paired the dishes with Philippe Foreau Vouvray Demi-Sec (2003). The rillettes was my favorite tasting by far! Chef Verot is a master of Head Cheese, and we were able to taste his Fromage de Tete. Head Cheese, in my opinion, is like coffee. You have to have it often, and the taste grows on you. I was just happy that this was served after my lunch break. Head Cheese for breakfast is asking a lot. Next, I tasted Spiced Seven-hour Braised Leg of Lamb. Both tastings were served with Chateau Pradeaux Bandol Rouge (2002). After amazing tastes from equally amazing chefs, I went to a seminar on cheese by Ihsan Gurdal, a fine cheese, meats and specialty food purveyor. He travels the world to find amazing products to sell in the U.S. I never realized how competitive and tricky his business can be. It makes sense. When a small cheese maker in a tiny village in France has a small amount of cheese to sell, you have to have an amazing connection with that farmer in order to get him to sell to you. It was an eye opening talk, and tasting cheese and wine during was icing on the cake! To end the evening, Chef Scott Conant prepared an amazing meal for a small number of us in a private room at Alto. Of course, the food was amazing, but I loved the fact that during the cocktail hour Veuve Cliquot Rose was being served. What better way to start a meal? (FYI, Veuve Cliquot is one of my favorite things in the world.)"

The exploding shack which appears, destroying itself in reverse (creating itself) amid a retracting fireball during the striking sequence where Bill Pullman transforms into Baltazar Getty, seems to evoke the exploding house at the climax of Aldrich’s 1958 ne plus ultra of noir. In fact, Lynch’s decision to film the shack exploding was one of his last-minute on-set inspirations. Filming the climactic reverse transformation later in the movie, which takes place in front of the shack, he suddenly flashed on the image of the building exploding. “So I asked the special effects guy what kind of really high-powered explosives he had. And he said that he had a lot, but that he could get more.”"

"3627","What inevitably gets omitted from the textbook is any discussion, based in actual historical examples, of the way that free trade works out in practice That would be awkward, because in the real world, throughout history, free trade pretty consistently hasn’t done what Ricardo’s rhetoric and today’s economics textbooks claim it will do. Instead, it amplifies the advantages of wealthy nations and the disadvantages of poorer ones, concentrating capital and income in the hands of those who already have plenty of both while squeezing out potential rivals and forcing down wages across the board. This is why every nation in history that’s ever developed a significant industrial sector to its economy has done so by rejecting the ideology of free trade, and building its industries behind a protective wall of tariffs, trade barriers, and capital controls, while those nations that have listened to the advice of the tame economists of the British and American empires have one and all remained mired in poverty and dependence as long as they did so."

There will certainly be no equivalent of the Bandit Country of South Armagh, which the South Armagh PIRA turned into a virtual no-go zone for the British Army for most of the Troubles, through the attentions of the South Armagh sniper and others. It will be as if every single rural area in NI had been utterly dominated by loyalist populations and paramilitaries, republicans had been entirely boxed into ghettoes, there had been no Republic of Ireland to act as training ground or sanctuary, and republicans would have been immediately identifiable as such if they were so foolish as to venture out into the countryside to try and test a bomb.

When he did not care, Melo walked around him like he was a pylon. Several times, even in Game Five, LeBron would casually stroll upcourt while Wade put on a series of impossible moves. Miami is clearly at their best when the two superstar’s play off each other, which happened with much more frequency in the first three gamers of the series. The players also need to sit Mario Chalmers down and inform him how a fast break works and that he must stop settling for open three’s when they have a clear numbers advantage (“Just take it to the basket Mario!”). Sometimes a three is a good shot but every time he let the ball go I groaned.

In modern vernacular, when someone says “copy me on it”, they mean CC them on that email, or, make sure they see the email, even though its contents aren’t directly addressed to them. The difference with BCC is that the recipient(s) can’t see who else is getting the email. It’s very sneaky, it’s a lovely little tool for when you’re sending something to a large list of people who may not want their emails shared, as is often the case with a press release. If you use Gmail, like I do, click ‘Add CC” or ‘Add BCC’ under the send box to get these options. (Also, you can email from different accounts via gmail! Incredibly handy!

"3809","This situation brings me to the workplace. Do you dislike any of your co-workers? Let’s pretend neither of us screamed YES!!!!!!!!!!!! to this question. But without being too irrational and direct, let’s think of the character of these people: conceited, bossy, selfish, rude, and simply miserable. They also love to bully you and target your flaws and put you down in group settings and really just make you feel so small. A bully really knows how to get under your skin, for example, one that I may know of actually targets social stereotypes that are so slick it is hardly detectable, and of course nobody does anything about it because bullies hold this power that dominates the submissive into a fearful state that they will be socially destroyed by taking action. How do you react? Go along with it? Smile, laugh, throw in a sugar coated negative comment that could make fun of them? Do you dream up ways of getting them fired or murdered? Okay, I am drifting in to the dark side. But when do you decide there is a line between being fake with them and having self integrity? I am trying to figure this out, too. Maintaining a calm and collected attitude while executing a job well done is the most important idea during a shift, and I certainly to not want to go to work without the pain of working with a monster and without feeling so awkward. After such a painful shift, it is like one needs to go home and regroup to feel like their normal self again. I hate the idea of having to put on a facade while at work, working is not only for the pay, but to do a great job for the company and have a peaceful environment with everyone. Some bitches just don’t get it. It is like a tribulation having to involve oneself with people who you KNOW talk behind your back then smile at your face. But thus far it has been a success to maintain a positive attitude and not run anyone over with a MAC truck. And you see? It rubs off on the person being bullied, for example, I have already called people bitches and douchebags in this post. I tried not to be hypocritical, perhaps slightly. These people are not perfect, as I have listed their flaws above, but it is their ignorance that is truly the end result of maximizing their flaws over their potential ability of a great worker. Maybe one day if it becomes far too intolerable, justice will be served or maybe they will change their bullying ways. Sadly, some people may never have the chance for reformity. The kindness they bestow now and then is just TOO fake to justify redemption."

The incremental capital output ratios for 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010 were 5.2%, 6.6%, 8.0% and more than 8.4%, respectively. The main culprits were foot-dragging projects, especially in the fields of power supply and transport infrastructure. Investment was scattered and inefficacious, not least in the case of Vinashin. Another testament to Vietnam’s woeful growth quality during this period was the slow pace of economic restructuring, as well as the economy’s limited competitiveness."

"3873","Playing Around: This tart is good made with pears. Make sure to pat them dry with paper towels before you lay them into the crust - pears are juicier than apples and their juices can slow the settling of the custard. When summer rolls around, the tart is good with peaches, which must be peeled, as well as apricots. If you use apricots, add 1/4 teaspoon pure almond extract to the custard - it will reinforce the fruit's flavor - and glaze the tart with apricot jam. With round fruits, like apricots and peaches, you can, if you'd like, forgo the slicing and just halve and pit the fruit, then lay the halves into the crust rounded side up."

He created Wendell, about a bright-eyed young man in an anonymous and his diverse set of friends. Although the style was less cute than Barefootz, the hero was still a clear optimist.

Conversely, if he has an attitude change and suddenly brightens up, you might use some stretch in your drawing to show him perking up and escaping gravity a bit.

Conversely, an intellectual vision unformed by the specific gospel narrative of Jesus (which is our means of “seeing Jesus”) is simply inadequate to the task of Christian hope, for the content of that hope is itself the “grace” of receiving the “apokalypsis of Jesus Christ” (1 Peter 1:13)."

If content in never being hypocritical, doesn’t that equate to never aspiring toward goodness? Should people always choose the natural (sin) route simply because that is more consistent with ‘who they really are’?"

For years, the memory of a deadly bombing at King’s Cross has haunted the brilliant Scotland Yard detective. His investigation has zeroed in on a ring of aristocratic rebels whose bloody campaign for Irish revolution is terrorizing the city. When he discovers one of the treacherous lords is acquainted with his free-spirited new tenant, Cassandra St. Cloud, his inquiry pulls him unexpectedly close to the heart of the conspiracy—and into the arms of a most intriguing lady."

"4006","There was an island at Lemington Point which was locally known as 'Canary Island' during World War I because of the effect cordite had on the skins of the munitions workers. The land was reclaimed after World War II and in 1958 the Anglo Great Lakes Corporation Ltd. Built a plant for the conversion of carbon into graphite for use in the nuclear industry. This was the beginning of the Lemington Industrial Estate."
"4007","This is the eighth (that’s right) eighth collaboration with Johnny Depp and director Tim Burton. This time based on the soap opera that ran from 1966-1971 on daytime television. The story tells of a man named Barnabas Collins (Depp) who has been cursed by a witch and turned into a vampire only to be buried alive for 200 years. Collins arises in the 1970s to a world of disco and Chevrolet cars. This is typical Burton territory, gothic oddball stories with comedy and Depp incorporated. I for one have grown a bit tired of Depp doing his same old schtick ever since playing Captain Jack Sparrow. The voice, the oddities and mannerisms seem too similar for most of the recent parts he has played. I for one think I can pass on this silly looking film as I think Burton has lost some of his creative charm as of late. The 2010 film Alice in Wonderland was quite a disappointment, substituting wild and crazy effects in place of a good story."

"4031","Now, there were some ""issues' if you could call them that at all. I think the biggest complaint I heard from most of the people around me was that there was little suspense, you pretty much kind of knew what was coming and how someone who going to be murdered. Example: Two girls on phone with other girl who lives next door when killer calls, says he's in the closet, two girls open closet and hes not there. Killer then says ""I never said I was in yours"" pops out of the next door neighbors closet and kills her. If you didn't see that coming from a mile away then you're probably blind, or getting popcorn and missing the action. I'm not that creative, but I still think after fifteen years, it's pretty difficult to come up with a new way for someone to to pop out and stab someone with a hunting knife, so there is little complaint from me on that one. The action was still really good and there still were a few parts that made me jump (and some thirty year old guy scream like a girl behind me)."

"4036","Benjamin Noys’ The Persistence of the Negative is an attempt, as he explains at its outset, to ‘rehabilitate a thinking of negativity through an immanent critique of contemporary Continental theory’ (ix). For Noys, the latter is currently dominated by what he refers to as ‘affirmationism’: a tendency towards the assertion of creativity, desire, productive potential and the importance of novelty. Such emphases on the primacy of affirmative, creative constitution are said to have cast negativity as secondary and reactive, and this, for Noys, is politically problematic: as affirmationism is often linked to the assertion of anti-capitalist possibilities, the denigration of negativity has furthered the neglect of issues pertaining to resistance and opposition. He thus sets out to ‘excavate’ (13) a new notion of negativity from contemporary affirmationism; a negativity that will provide a means of strategically locating and actualising points of ‘rupture’ (4) within capitalist society."

There is a space you land on where you can take the kids to the babysitter (babysitter being whatever player you choose) and “forget” they are there. Then the babysitter adds that many more kids to their kid list. By the way, each kid you have takes away $10 from your payday.

I don't need the belly band often but on occasion I wear a pair of pants that I cannot button so this little stretchy thing comes in handy!

I know 20% cuts have been imposed on the Home Office, but is this really the right thing to do? From an ethical view point at least, most certainly not. Also, with less accountability to the public, how can we guarantee the safety of the public from abuse of power, or even regarding witness statements?

But it’s a rare thing to discover an author whose voice moves me, whose thinking challenges me, whose writing taps into a sort of “Yes! That’s true!” that has me using exclamation points (and I don’t use exclamation points; I think they’re lazy). Dostoevsky does this for me. Dietrich Bonhoeffer. David Foster Wallace.

The unfortunate part was the mojo verde dip, which was much too salty for all four of us.

There was really no choice; A Sentimental Education and Burger's Daughter are both pretty long and complex, so following them with the long complexities of Petals of Blood was just too much for the students, though they gave it a good shot. I should probably just do a whole course of those three books, but I like having a couple shorter books in there, too. So Petals of Blood had to go. River Between is fine, but it's simpler and not as perfect for our theme of ""revolution"", so I'm definitely disappointed. If the term were even just one week longer, we'd still be able to fit Petals of Blood in, but I just couldn't make it work with the current schedule. We may not even get to do River Between — just last week, the campus bookstore let me know they can't get copies from their distributor because the book is effectively out of print. It's still perfectly available via Amazon, Barnes & Noble, etc., so I'm going to see if the students are willing to order copies themselves (if they haven't done so already).

It was also quite interesting to find out that a BUNCH of people are local and I NEVER see them around town! What's up with that?

Hubby spends most of the movie living up to his wedding vows.. He will stop at nothing to help wifey get her memory back of them madly in love together-thru thick and thin, better or worse- in theory sounds romantic. Reality-- Ho hum.. I wanted Ryan Gosling to barge in to show Channing Tatum seduction 101 and grab Rachel McAdams in the pouring rain to remind her, "" It wasn't over..

Empty calories. Loved all the actors. Jessica Lange will pull you in with a single gesture to her heart. Rachel McAdams is better than this cheese puff flick; Channing Tatum's full back-al was a definite perk of the movie. The disconnect I felt came from lazy story-telling followed by rushed editing due to a case of ""how fast can we get a film out around Valentine's Day b/c their is nothing else to compete with it?"".

My band had just finished our number...Brother Louie, a Stories cover song and a couple of us just remained on stage to back up Louise.

I loved his utter sweetness and determination to survive in a world that is prejudiced against him because of his looks and because he’s a shifter. Shifter’s are hunted down and immediately killed, so he must hide his true identity from others so he can survive. This is also difficult for him because Lyndarum is considered flawed and worthless because of the freckles that cover his face and body. This was a great shame because Lyndarum was truly as beautiful on the outside as he was on the inside, and it’s because of this beauty, it makes Kirk want to be a better man so he can deserve Lyndarum’s love."

I bought this when I saw Tosh's card featuring the Black mesh, which I also bought and will be using real soon- LOL. Blue Swarovski crystal from Jolees. The sentiment is from a Kraftin Kimme set. Although it is hard to see in the pic, I also used Blue iridescent Pebbles chalk for the clouds around her."

Sadly, as I browsed the rack, I found that most of what was there was not to my taste and, those that were, were waaaay overpriced. But that doesn't lessen the coolness factor one bit!"

"4251","I had been wrestling with poor self-esteem since the onset of adolescence and was painfully shy outside of my immediate friendship circle. Moving at age 16 to a mixed A’Level college from an all-boys grammar school was like arriving on the doorsteps of heaven. Unfortunately, whilst I was very interested in girls, few of them were interested in me. Actually, I have no idea whether they were interested or not, because very few of them appeared to be aware that I existed. But quite by accident I discovered the power of style."

"4253","The Obama bipartisan deficit commission was tasked with the challenge of how to raise revenue, grow the economy and pay off the debt. After an exhaustive study the commission concluded that lowering tax rates, lowering the corporate tax rate and simplifying the tax code to encourage tax compliance, and to encourage more wealth to come back home (so it at least can be taxed), was the most prudent course of action. Reagan would have been pleased with those recommendations."

Obviously the poll does not go into people’s motivation, but it is noticeable that the biggest single category was those who did all, or virtually all, their drinking at home. I would once have said “mostly in the pub” but am now more “half and half”."

So we went on a little pilgrimage, although it wasn't a family history session or anything. We had a lovely day.

Still, you have to take care of them, not use them and not abuse them.

But other than that, most people just ordered via the 'Can I have that beer' and let the bar decide the serving size. This is good for us customers as some beers are very expensive as pints but 2/3 glass size that work out better and this also works well for 6% beers I found."

"4273","Are you a meticulously clean person? Or have you, too, felt the shame of having to haul a huge stack of books with no particular home into a back bedroom amongst unfolded laundry and an unmade bed to make at least PART of the house presentable? My mother and my grandmother were/are always SUPER bad about spring cleaning and purging their houses of unnecessary items. I love them, but rethinking household management of items was never a strength. If there was a shelf or a box or a cabinet to put it in, whatever spoon, wall hanging, fifteen year old dress was STAYING. The time frame for onset of this behavior in my grandmother confuses me, as there's neither hide nor hair of the wackadoodle, adorable Heywood-Wakefield esque end tables I see in family photos, nor the fifties' console tv, nor any other atomic age trappings...yet any item that drifted into the house past the year 1975 is still in the house. Like a dinner guest that won't leave. Who knows? Maybe semi-hoarding was her midlife crisis.In my mom's case, the pack-rattin' was actually kind of a boon for high school age me, as despite a slight height differential, we were about the same size, and her entire bicentennial high school wardrobe was pretty much intact in cardboard boxes in the attic when I discovered them in seventh grade on an expedition into the attic for Christmas decorations. Dresses, skirt and blouse sets, and what seemed like endless patterned shirts were worn and worn and worn until eventually being decommissioned from sheer tattiness. Do you ever wonder if the deep crimson-with-with-sheer-black-overlay Homecoming outfit from the year 2000, so heinous to you now you practically have to use tongs to put it in the going-to-Goodwill pile, will someday set the pulses of future generations of vintageophiles racing? I hope not, but I reckon so."

I was so excited to see how surprised he was with his gift. It totally made my Christmas. After exchanging gifts, we passed out and woke up at 4:30 the next morning so that he could continue his trip and I could make the trek back to Newark. I spent the day with my mom lounging around watching movies and then he came over and set up his new Kindle Fire. Mom and I watched ""It's a Wonderful Life"" which I can now cross off The Movie List and I absolutely loved it."

This, in turn, produced the reaction which we know as the Age of Enlightenment, the eighteenth century, which threw out religion altogether and tried to base life upon human reason and common sense. This is basically what civilization is trying to live on today. And this is what has produced the Communism out of which Solzhenitsyn came, and against which he is protesting. Communism is the last and most consistent form of trying to make life on earth solely fit human ideas, not divine ones."

"4304","I suggest getting one of the smaller binders -- mine is approximately 7 inches by 9 inches. Larger ones would be fine, but the smaller one is easy to keep with your Bible. I prefer the kind with a clear pocket on the front and back covers, to slip your own “cover art” into. Mine has a colorful picture on the front cover, along with the words “Prayer Journal” and a favorite quotation on prayer. On the back cover there’s another colorful picture (I cut these from Gooseberry Patch catalogs, as these picture many of my favorite things) , part of a poem about prayer, and a verse (James 5:16). I cut card stock sheets in half to fit my binder and -- after punching holes in them -- used them as dividers for the different sections. I used index tabs to label the different sections. I cut white paper in half, punched holes on one side, and used these to write my actual requests on. For the special people in my life, I have their photos (stuck to card stock with clear photo corners) right across from the page with my prayer requests for them. Whenever I come across something that will help me in my prayer life, I incorporate it into my prayer journal. For example, one mission board made available a bookmark listing basic, biblical ways to pray for missionaries. I cut this up and scattered the different requests on the card stock divider for my “Missionaries” page. Every time I pray for missionaries, I have before me some concrete ways to pray for them."

It is claimed (by the political right) that more Republican than Nationalist bodies are buried in the Valley. The left claim that this is only because there weren’t enough Nationalist dead to fill it, and are campaigning to have the leftist bodies exhumed and removed. They also claim that the monument was built with the unwilling labour of Republican politcal prisoners.

Well, if you can look around the world that you live in and not find anything that could do with making better, then you’re fortunate indeed…and living on another planet. Unfortunately, planet Earth and its inhabitants are labouring under a long list of predicaments in desperate need of sorting out. I won’t list them because the words and phrases fail to carry the full meaning and in too many people’s minds have become just words. For instance, unless you’ve experienced it or made the effort to discern the real meaning of the word, ‘homelessness’ is just another one of those words and doesn’t convey anything of the discomfort, hopelessness, trauma, desperation, etc, etc, of the condition itself. (For a window into that world read A Little Matched World, a modern-day adaptation of Hans Christian Anderson’s The Little Match Girl, which was my way of doing something, encouraging people think, about the issue.)"

We wait for orders, Transportation, dates, and housing. We sometimes have to wait on Christmas, birthday and anniversary celebrations. We wait for phone calls that will always come at the worst possible moments and require you to give up a perfectly wonderful Saturday evening.

City Council approved in January…Under its proposed law, the city would require producers to hire on-set medical professionals, who would attest to appropriate condom use. At the end of a shoot, the producers would have to send their unedited video to the police department, where employees would scrutinize it…The city’s preemptive strike is pointless, said Diane Duke, executive director of the Free Speech Coalition…”Very little filming is done in Simi Valley, and I doubt that the production studios are planning any increase at all in the area…However, I am amused at the thought of Simi Valley hiring people to sit around and view porn on taxpayer dollars. I wonder what the training for that would look like.”"

The Sixers have done a great job since their horrible start of avoiding long losing streaks."
"4372","It is not hard to imagine why people work more when they are free to take as many vacations as they need. They are better able to decide the best times to take time off from work and plan their work accordingly. Not everyone can fit into the standard two-week vacation schedule simply because everybody is different with different needs. If one person wants to take a day off every other week, but is capable of completing and exceeding his expectations, then there is no reason for that person to be spending wasteful hours at the office when they have no urge to be there."
"4373","By Christof Lehmann – Aarhus – nsnbc. Yesterday the Danish City of Aarhus became the focus and meeting point of the European Right, including the English Defense League, the Danish Defense League, and right-wing to fascist organizations from Finland, Poland, Russia, Germany and other European nations. It is likely that the right wing meeting can be considered as a seminal event for gathering the European Right under a common program. The meeting was outnumbered by the biggest demonstration in Aarhus since 2006, with approximately 5.000 people marching through the city, shouting slogans like “No fascism in our streets – Make Place for Everybody who makes Place for Everybody“, and most prominently “Aarhus for Diversity“."

Also, these monkeys would sit on the branches further away from the tree because, even though leopards can climb trees, the branches could not support the leopard's weight. When an eagle alarm call is given, vervet monkeys would make them look up, run for the nearest bush or both to avoid an approaching aerial attack. Python alarm calls would the monkeys stand bipedally and look down on the ground."

While it may seem like this is the product of human ingenuity and hard work, any good farmer will tell you that there’s really not much you can do to get yields of the magnitude suggested by this passage. Sure there are bumper crops, but not because of anything any farmer did to make it happen. Studies have shown that even our best technological attempts to improve yield can’t out perform nature. So, the provision of food to carry people through three years on one year of production is a miracle intended to tell them, “Quit worrying about it and trust me”."

His birthday was coming, and he had just started full-day school days. I was weepy as I was wandering, still in the thick of the “letting go” process. It was hard for me to stomach him being under someone else’s charge, and apparently it was hard for him, too, as he was exhibiting some spikes in bad behavior. I wanted to wrap him up and tuck him away from the world, but I knew that I would not be able to shield him from “real life” forever. It made my heart crack."

"4441","The significant result of this chore-cum-beating was that the only toilet facility in each cell was now down at the pit. Those detainees destined to remain in their cells for the day would be without the luxury of a tolet until 1700 hrs. Furthermore, we had no water or soap to wash our hands, so the men and the cell degenerated into a pretty disgusting condition. Because of the unhygienic conditions under which we lived, much of the time we had diarhoea and it was absolute agony not having access to a toilet facility during the day. One could not sit down or one was sunk! We 'tap danced' all day to avoid messing in our pants or the cell. Aside from the embarrassment, discomfort, humiliation and of course the smell, if one had an 'accident', the guards would beat up the offender. At times I felt that I had been degraded to an animal status and I had to keep reminding myself that the guilt must lie with Mbokodo, not me. One had no privacy, and when the four-litre containers which had dried faeces on the inside and outside were returned to the cells, we all rushed to join the queue to use them. The physical discomfort was so great that one was oblivious of any sense of shame or embarrassment. (p.86-87)"

Granted, this story takes place in 1866 and it may be possible to dismiss it, somewhat, as attempting to be accurate to attitudes of the period, but in the very next story we have a similar portrayal with Toberman. It’s a shame if it is true, but these episodes were produced in the 1960s, and they will reflect 60s ideas, both good and bad."
"4498","In an effort to counteract this, individuals (most of whom are either ironically or fittingly outside of the political sphere) have tried to either revert or adapt their ideologies to ‘traditional values’ in an effort to try to woo disillusioned ‘small-c’ conservatives and social conservatives back to the fold. The first of these was Phillip Blond’s ‘Red Tory‘ ideal – a sort of renewed Conservatism for the post-Thatcherist. But what has been the most intriguing, certainly from the perspective of an English nationalist is the ‘Blue Labour’ permutation."

Mornings like this one make me realize that now that I’ve lived here, I’ll never be able to live anywhere else. Sure, I’ll probably not live in this particular house forever, but from where I’m sitting, Brownstown, Indiana is looking pretty darn good."

Lars, however, made a very good point that this was a ""lovely unintentional parody of German attitude to Reinhetsgebot."" And he's right, of course.

Looking back, I wonder if I, young as I was, took Douglas, and the victim (as I considered him), and myself far too seriously.

Is there a Rush on the left? Is there a left wing talking head who is nationally known by both sides? Is there a left wing talking head currently under a $400 million contract? Is there a left wing talking head with a claimed 20 million listeners? Is there a left wing talking head who Democratic political leaders are afraid to repudiate? Oh sure, every now and again you hear something inappropriate from Lynn Samuels, Ed Shultz, and more frequelty than every now and again from Bill Marr. But the top talking heads on the left, in general, do not take it to the level the top from the right does. The top tier left would not harrass and stalk 12-year-old Graeme Frost, they wouldn’t call the Secretary of State a ‘worthless bitch’, and they wouldn’t make death threats against the President of the United States. There is no Rush on the left. There is no Michael Savage on the left, and even though sometimes I think Ed Shultz is trying to be Rush Limbaugh, he’s got a lot more ignorance, prejudice, and ego to go before he can claim that title. In preparation for writing this blog entry I surfed the internet for almost 2 hours trying to find ‘outrageous comments by the left wing’, and what I found was bloggers and idiots (although sometimes one in the same), but no top tier, nationally known, syndicated people. No left wing Rush. Some, including myself, think this is a good thing because it allows the left to legitimately claim higher moral ground. Other left leaning intellectuals I have spoken with don’t entirely agree though. The Rush method is crass, dishonest, and irresponsible; but it works. It wins elections. It moves the conversation forward for the right, and furthers the various myths that a majority of America wants no choice, an ongoing war, lower pay for women, a bible in every state assembly, and to willfully fork over more of their income to the rich. People don’t believe all this on the whole, but by relentlessly continuing the conversation, they will start to believe that they are actually in the minority. And this leads to acceptance. And that’s unacceptable. It works for the right and perhaps we should get on board, but we haven’t yet and that’s the point. The right likes to claim an equivalency not because it’s real, but because it is their version of an affirmative defense of their actions. They make no apology of saying anti-war veterans are ‘phony soldiers’ but feel justified in simply saying “yeah, but your side does it too.” Sorry guys we don’t, for better or worse, and even if we did, ‘he hit me first’ is not a justification for using the power of your voice to divide us rather than encourage common ground. We don’t have a Rush. The equivalency is false."

Christian had recently earned his pilot’s license, and they were up for adventure, along with Christian’s flight instructor and friend. They spent a beautiful day flying to New Mexico to visit Christian’s family’s ranch. En route to home, the three stopped to refuel the plane, and shortly after taking off again, one of the small plane’s engines stalled and the plane crashed. Doug, who was at the controls, did not survive. Christian was burned over 30% of his body and suffered a broken back, and Stephanie was burned over 80% of her body."

Waiting to ask me if Michael Jackson had ever gone to the moon to learn to moon walk or why fish never blink when they clearly have water in their eyes. Its eerie and frightening."
"4649","The tables tumbled, the merchants fled. The Pharisees stormed across to each other, then to the door, then re-entered striding with purpose, only to stop far distant, gesticulating and exclaiming to each other, like actors playing in the audience, without a part in this magnificent drama on what had been their own stage. In those with nothing to lose from the scourge a thrill arose, like the thrill of lightning and the clap of thunder when a brewing storm finally breaks. And as it broke a lightness filled the air, and amidst the tempest the gentle rain of Jesus’ tears began to fall as he sailed atop the thunder cloud of cleansing, until all was spent, and he sat again, and wiped his eyes and his brow."

For example: I just couldn't 'get' AGUIRRE, WRATH OF GOD (monkey armies? When?) and GRIZZLY MAN (there's audio of a fatal bear attack and you won't play it?) Then there's Herzog's titles, which are often whole sentences in length: LITTLE DIETER NEEDS TO FLY? Excuse me? Am I blocking the runway? EVEN DWARFS STARTED SMALL? Es tu serio? That's the title of your film? Why assume they wouldn't?! My Argentine ex-wife had an old PAL VHS of DWARFS on our shelf for years and just the spine filled me with horror at the thought she would one day force me to watch it. Nothing personal. I was just a dumb Yankee at the time, and knew for example, nothing of the rest of the world and the little creatures in it."

She plays a distracted secretary and twin sisters with two very distinct personalities. One is a wholesome blonde and the other an assertive, pushy redhead, both the daughters of a wealthy businessman who has a lot of interest involved in why Joe agrees to leap into the volcano. Since Joe now has nothing much to live for, he’s inspired to actually live, have fun, take risks, and just plain “go for it” because there’s nothing to lose."

Everyone seemed interested in making friends with them, and my kids were SO excited about it. Thats the way it should be :) My kids are DEFINITLY in the minority. I think our school here is about 95% hispanic. Eme was the only white kid in her class, and I think there was on other in Joe's. Hehehehe. It's good for them.

"4690","Most people take on a job to meet one or more of the six human needs, be it certainty, uncertainty, connection, growth, contribution or significance. The idea is that having a job will provide financial security, either temporarily or indefinitely for some, depending on their goals and intentions. For others having a job meets the need of significance where by you might lead a team or run a department, or even the business or company itself. For others the job provides uncertainty or variety from an other wise mundane life. Whatever the reason, some part of your belief system feels that having a job will meet these needs. If your job makes you happy and meets your needs then a huge high five to you, nothing beats being happy. For those saying, “Tell me about, I can’t wait to leave this place!” then we need to talk here for a moment. By the way, a job can also be your business or company."

Unfortunately, FB didn't upload the photo the way I wanted to so I'm back to the drawing board on it. They are (in birth order) Isaiah (Amy's), Alexander (Shaun's), Kaitlyn (Shaun's), Zachary (Shaun's), Anna (Amy's), and Tristan (Shaun's newest). It's amazing how much alike Shaun's boys look. Except for Isaiah, these are all their ""coming home"" photos. I had one of Kaitlyn in her car seat, too but the toys hanging down pretty much blocked her face. She is such a beautiful child with long dark hair. All of the kids are beautiful (I'm not just prejudiced, either - lol - much). It's hard to tell in the picture but Tristan was the heaviest of all the kids at 8 lbs 6.5 oz and 21 inches. Isaiah was a little over 7 pounds and 20.5 inches. I don't remember Anna's weight (I think she was close to 7 pounds) but she was only 19 inches long. Shaun's other babies were all right at 6 lbs and a few ounces - and 19 inches long."
"4700","As my moto skills weren’t necessarily the best in the big cities, I decided to forego the first leg of the trip with the rest of the guys, which saw them travel from Tamale, through Kumasi and down to the capital of Ghana, Accra. Instead, I met them in the southern part of the Volta Region, near a city called Ho. It meant two days of long rides by myself in a part of the country I never really knew about, beyond constantly hearing how beautiful it was from people that have been (it’s the part of the country that most tourists stick to)."

"4703","I was surprised to find this picture as the sixth in my folder, and the moment I saw it, the precise memories of what I was doing at the time jumped straight to the forefront of my mind. I could tell you about how my poor connection lagged terribly that day in Stormwind with all the post-patch crowding on the realm and how I got turned around in the north alley of the Trade District trying to find the barber shop (I very, very rarely use it). I could tell you how we searched for the perfect spot to dance and take screenshots. I could even tell you that this shot is not my favorite from that day; that honor belongs to one Catulla took and features some random toon flying by in the background, an oddly floating Worg Pup in tow, because the “flying non-combat pet” bug had yet to be fixed for pets that weren’t supposed to fly. Random gliding doggie is still an in-joke that makes me grin, though I acknowledge its lack of meaning to anyone but myself."

They were commercials about stocks, but we all watched them for the shock value of that talking baby.

She will keep an eye on things but I’m also going to formally request that D is not in a class with the bullying child from September. Enough is enough! I have asked D why she doesn’t tell him to stop it but she’s worried about being told off. There are two parallel classes so I can’t see that being a problem."

I thought that I was getting a good deal on some target loads, but I didn't read the fine print on the internet ad page and I learned too ate that they were only ""cowboy"" loads, loaded light for Cowboy Action Shooting. They're only pushing 800fps instead of the 1250fps or so that I prefer, but they still go ""BANG!"" and I've got some nice Starline brass to reload when the cases are empty. So I whacked away at the falling plates on my range for a bit, well on my way to developing a practice that I call ""conservation shooting"" (always leave one standing...for future generations, you know.). Ideally I like to drop six plates for six shots, finishing a string with no plates and no rounds left, but today it just wasn't there other than sporadically. I guess if I'm attacked by six bad guys (and don't have a reload handy), I'll ust have to be content with dropping five and hoping that the last one changes his mind."

What they ended up in is a hardbound 11 x 13 wedding album nay, volume, with a glossy dust jacket and hundreds of wedding photos spread out over 126 glorious, premium-papered pages. And the only thing more crazy than having such a hefty, museum-quality wedding album, is the fact that I did it all myself."
"4732","The answer becomes obvious if we posit (as I have done at length elsewhere) that Leftists really have no concern at all about what they are advocating, that they do not really care about human advancement at all, that their ""concern"" for the poor etc. is a sham. What they really want they want now -- and that is power, simple causes that will win them praise and drama in which they can star as the good guys. That really is about all. And neo-liberalism meets none of those needs. The policies advocated by Neo-liberals do demonstrably lead to slow but steady human economic advancement and do increase prosperity for all to levels once undreamt of in human history. But such policies also diffuse power, are far from simple and are very undramatic. It is hard work just to understand neo-liberalism and there are no immediate rewards inbuilt. One could, for instance, TRY going onto the streets and demonstrating in favour of ""comparative advantage"" (one of the essential ideas underpinning advocacy of free trade) but that would almost certainly lead to total incomprehension rather than win kudos. And Che Guevara is someone that anybody and everybody can understand -- which is a lot more than can be said for Eugen von Boehm-Bawerk."

We try to show each other that we care about what the other person really likes in life but that is not easy. She loves to write, read, listen to loud music, sing, throw parties and the like. I love to hunt and fish. I listen to music but I am not stirred by it the way she is. I know she wishes that were different. I know other people probably wished that I was different, that I was more like them, and this would make them want me around more and be able to talk to me and accept me because I would be more like the rest of the family. I can't help that fact. God has just given me a passion for the outdoors."

The film's central mystery never really carries the doom-laden life-or-death feeling of, say, Chinatown (1974) or The Ninth Gate (1999); instead, Polanski seems to mostly be taking pleasure in his own mastery, filling his film with a wealth of idiosyncratic visual and literary touches that lend its relatively humdrum plot a welcome off-kilter quality that makes it considerably more gripping than it might have been in less confident hands."

And it's so hard to know what to do. I think we all donate as much money as we can afford and of course send our prayers and best wishes to everyone, but most of all I think we all just turn and see what we've got and count our blessings."

"4758","The need to know and the ability to predict what others are thinking to do or will do or how nature behaves is essential part of human scientific spiritual growth from the time we discovered Fire. For example we want to know whether rains come or not next year. This helps farmers to decide to either sow or not to sow. The rain pattern helps governments to prepare for draught management. Oppositions parties to blame governments. Again if rains come we want to know will there be heavy rains so that flood management can be activated. We want to know if there will be medium rains and limited water availability then planning can be done for alternate crop patterns. We also want to know if there will be very little rains so draught crops can be sown and water conservation can be activated. If there are super heavy rains like cyclones we want to know at least 2 days before so that all population can be evacuated to safe areas. The entire meteorology departments were existing for this function of predicting cyclones using again mathematical modeling of temperatures, wind gusts moisture etc."

I had not had previous experience with them except to be taken as a guest to a game once or twice at which I had sat around saying ""What do I do now?"" and someone would reply ""Roll the dice"". I would roll the dice not really grasping it and they would shout out a number and something might die or not but I just didn't ""get it"". SO, in the spirit of making me understand why he loves games so much he took me to a convention called Origins in Columbus, Ohio."

"4770","Our senses, however, and our natures themselves, have no immediate and single purpose the way a bat's sonar is immediately directed toward prey location. We don't hunt by instinct in the manner of a hawk or dog, but must consider the nature of possible prey and how best to capture it. We must understand the world in order to survive in it. Neither are we born with fur like a bear or build nests by instinct like a bird. We must figure out what will work for clothing and how to get it, and what will work for shelter and how to make it. This is why Aristotle says that the relevant distinction with respect to man is that he is rational, which means more than merely the degenerate ""thinker"" of modern thought, but an animal whose nature is to understand the world. And since we see that nature doesn't fail in its purposes (the bat's sonar does locate it's prey, the hawks eyes do see the mouse on the ground, etc.), why should we entertain the idea that our nature, uniquely among the creatures, fails to do what it is clearly meant to do - and that is to understand the world as it really is?"

In the unified variant, the community is white, male, very old or young, right wing, and sexist/racist. The lack of norms is a distinguishing feature. There are few women or minorities, especially in leadership roles, and they are not respected. This is of course specific to gnu atheism and religion, and due to the exact same causes. Respected atheist women, minorities, and leftists in leadership roles have spoken eloquently about representation. Using quotations from them about their nonexistence is fine, as long as it’s done with a delicate and subtle touch. In the conflict version, disagreements over politics, tactics, or representation are acrimonious Deep Rifts. Deep rifts sell!"

A training squad for example should be chosen in November containing of around 40 players. These could meet up for a few days of training in November and again in January or February before the final squad is announced. Ideally these training camps would involve a challenge match perhaps against an EIHL select side if a national side could not be found but just meeting up more often would be an improvement."

The garbage truck takes it away. Where? Here’s where you may encounter some blank stares…but some might say dump or landfill. Now really, what is a landfill? It’s a big hole on the ground all sealed up to keep the toxic nasty things in our trash from getting into our soil and water (sometimes they leak!). So here’s the big riddle: What’s the problem with landfills if we can’t reuse or recycle everything we buy and use in our daily lives? They fill up of course!"

My mind wandered in and out of his talk and I began to immediately write in my unwritten novel. I wished for a scribe, someone who could listen to my musings and do the physical act of writing for me. Then I cursed such an idea because most of the time my writing is not premeditated and comes through my fingers as if they had minds of their own. No, I would have to do it myself. I have started many books, but I can somehow never finish; a trait that is not otherwise commonplace for me. In general, I finish what I start and of course I am very cautious of things I start.

I mean in particular, for example, the increase in the last several decades of outright Satanism – Satan-worship – which only in these last twenty years or so has achieved such openness and notoriety. People openly call themselves witches. Perhaps few call themselves Satanists, but it has become a recognized religion in our society, and very many are seriously involved in the practice of witchcraft. (The widely publicized ritual murders of recent years are only the surface of a deep current of evil and demon-worship.)"

"4856","It's a stifling tendency. Whether it's in the context of an outfit or a space, there needs to be room to breathe. When we made the move to Pittsburgh, we only had three weeks notice of our departure, which lead to us moving with more stuff than we needed to. There was no time to clean out, throw out, or sort, all this baggage came with us from our past life and every weekend I sort, throw away, and donate more unwanted, and unnecessary stuff. It's not just our apartment, it's my closet as well. As I unpacked my summer stuff from storage, I noticed hemlines and silhouettes that were no longer of interest to me. After the initial purging of stuff, I felt as if I was finished, like I had gotten rid of what I had to. But as I scanned my closet yesterday, looking for this dress, I saw lurkers. I'm clearly not finished yet."

This bartender, making friendly banter, had said the film in question wasn't as good as the book, but that it was still quite good. Apparently this bartender had been horrifically misinformed and, although this other person hadn't actually read the original book, he'd decided to come back into the peaceful bar to threateningly tell the bartender what an idiot he was. It wasn't 'quite' good, he said through gritted teeth with finger pointed, it was 'very' good, and he should get his facts straight."

There are hundreds of examples, from the people who choose careers based on the money and are chained to working 80 hour weeks at jobs that aren’t fulfilling, to gambling addicts, to shopaholics, to plain old thieves–the list goes on and on. But we also don’t want to react in fear to these possibilities, and run away from money.

"4873","The only reason that I can think of why Michael Haneke has decided to do an American remake of his 1997 film, Funny Games, is because he really, really likes fucking with his audience. The first Haneke film I saw, The Time of the Wolf, lost me video rental privileges in my apartment for at least a month. The second, Cache, was one of my favorite films of 2006. Funny Games is like Cache, in that it uses the medium of film itself to implicate the viewer in what's going on onscreen. The premise is simple - a family is vacationing at their lake house when two young men appear at the door and take them hostage. The villains (Peter & Paul/Tom & Jerry/Bevis & Butt-Head) aren't motivated by theft, rape, or anything other than sadism. It's a recipe for a very sick movie, especially since the director is a genius at ratcheting up the tension (his films are worth re-watching just for the framing). But Haneke really goes the extra mile here with the interlocking use of two devices."

You'll never hear music this way in a concert hall, but that may be irrelevant because Fujikura's sound world is far closer to Jimmy Hendrix' guitar feedback effects than to the buttery textures of a Brahms symphony floating in the acoustic warmth of the Boston Symphony Hall. Boulez delivered Fujikura's Fifth Station with such adrenalin-drenched intensity, and with such reassuring control of the piece's frenetic energy, that not even for a moment did I listen to the music ""from the outside"", so to speak. I simply went along for the ride, which felt like the 3:00 a.m. drag race on Hollywood Boulevard."

Because of Christ, we are considered righteous before God and yet we still suffer (even more so than in our old life). Although Job did not expect it, we should. Job persevered until the end and was blessed immensely by God. We may not see material blessing in this life but we do have the hope in Christ of that glorious future eternal blessing that awaits us."

It lacked real information. If you haven’t seen the film or know nothing about their purpose, let me catch you up to speed with my version. Three clueless college kids head to Sudan with no plans and no idea about what they’re going to find. They’re looking for a “story”. They leave Sudan and make their way into Uganda. They find some bad stuff going on there. So they made a MTV-esque DVD about what was happening there. They wanted to draw attention to what they found."

"4958","In 1978, Ed Koch replaced Abe Beame as Mayor. Although Koch had begun his political career as a liberal reformer and a bitter opponent of Carmine DeSapio, he had generally friendly relations with Jim McManus, and in fact in the one election in which McManus was challenged in 1984, Koch appeared at his victory party. Koch’s approach to his position as Mayor was to support development and economic growth in the City generally by privatizing City development efforts through leases of land to private developers who would construct projects. He thus sought to act as a cheerleader for economic activity, which revived in the 1980’s. One of his major projects was Times Square redevelopment, which involved the condemnation and purchase of land in the block between seventh and eighth avenues, the historical heart of 42nd Street and the theater district. It was proposed that the entire block would be condemned and acquired by the City and then or sold/ leased to private developers who would construct large office buildings with heavy City subsidies. In this way this central but deteriorated block now home to the same kind of urban blight of prostitutes, pimps and a number of pornographic bookstores as in Hell’s Kitchen in the 70’s would be replaced by a modern state of the art commercial district. The plan was bitterly opposed by the Durst and Brandt families who were the major landowners on the block as a waste of taxpayer money and totally out of character with the historical role of the area as the City’s entertainment center. However, the plan was approved by the City’s Board of Estimate and most of the land was condemned. By the time all the lawsuits challenging the project were settled, the success of the efforts to defeat the urban blight in Hell’s Kitchen was becoming clear, and many began to ask more loudly why such a huge government subsidized project was necessary, if on the next block across eighth avenue in Hell’s Kitchen, with Manhattan Plaza and theater row there could be such substantial development of clean entertainment uses without large government subsidies. It was rarely, if ever mentioned that, unlike the massive redevelopment plan for Times Square which was designed in an office downtown, the moving force for the redevelopment of the area West of Eighth had been the community and its political leadership—principally Jimmy McManus and the McManus Democratic Association. However, partially as a result of these considerations and the stock market crash of 1987, there were significant revisions to the Times Square redevelopment plan to include more entertainment uses, and ultimately to include the Durst family as a developer of several of the office buildings."

A roar that never sounded, at least not to Charlie’s ears, for as he took the tiger out from the belly of the machine, the gears came to life, clanging and smashing, a divine roar that shook the factory.

Furthermore, the death counts have obviously been exaggerated, as recent reports note that more than 100 folks have been found alive in the affected area.

It was in 1916 that the company made Roscoe ""Fatty"" Arbuckle the then unprecedented offer of $1000 a day and complete creative control. Mr. Arbuckle formed his own company, Comique, with Joseph Schenck to produce short subjects that would be distributed by Paramount. This arrangement would prove so successful that Fatty Arbuckle would graduate to making feature films at Famous Players-Lasky Corporation. His features at Famous Players-Lasky Corporation included the second screen adaptation of Brewster's Millions (1921), The Dollar a Year Man (1921), The Travelling Salesman (1921), and others. Roscoe Arbuckle's feature films at Famous Players-Lasky Corporation were very successful.

Besides enjoying the central plot, I had a good time chuckling at the portrayal of gender roles shifting at the time the story was written. As some of you might know, roaring twenties became famous for birth of jazz age and popularization of an image of a free woman that was not suppressed by no man. These young girls shed corsets, embraced cigarettes and learned to speak their minds. They, of course, were called flappers. In the beginning of the book Hastings runs into such a girl and unbeknownst to himself is immediately smitten by her. At first, he is shocked by the girl’s unconventional behaviour, yet somehow manages to be charmed. He writes:"

I was talking to my sister in law, Missy one day about not feeling any flutters yet and later that night I finally felt them!

"5158","The self extends into the world step by step, and we can withdraw it along the same route in reverse. The withdrawal begins with all of the physical activities we perform with our senses. “Sacrificing these into the mind” means stopping all those activities and giving their energy to the mind. Next, we take all the contemplations, opinions, and desires of the mind and grind them all to a halt. The energy released by halting the ever-wandering mind is then placed into our life’s breath. Then we push the life’s breath downward, allowing death to begin taking claim of our body. When death claims the body, it recycles it by breaking it down into the chemical components that form it. There are five categories of components: called earth (solids), water (liquids), fire (energies), air (gasses), and ether (space)."

I am grateful to know that they come out the other side and continue to grow and mature. That they won't act this way forever, and that I haven't done something to ruin them. I am no longer fearful of this behavior. Annoyed, of course! But, that's all.

"5195","Love never became a big concert draw outside of California. They did some weekend tour dates in the rest of the country, but it was only in their hometown of Los Angeles or in San Francisco that they played regularly. A stable income from concerts would probably have helped the band weather some of their personal changes. Changing band members seemed almost routine for the big L.A. groups in 1967/68. Neil Young quit The Buffalo Springfield, Gene Clark had already left and David Crosby was fired from The Byrds in ’68. The rock scene was so new and continually changing that everyone thought their “next” lineup or group would be even bigger than what they were leaving (ultimately true for Crosby & Young). Big ambition coupled with big egos created a volatile music scene, and Love was no different than the rest of the aspiring groups of that era. Personality conflicts between members, poor management and drugs were three key areas’ that could help break a band apart, and Love had its share of all three."

She wasn't paying attention in class, she was pestering her classmates, she wasn't finishing her in-class work, and overall was having trouble focusing or making bad decisions and was very hard to motivate, so her teacher put her on a behavior contract. So, it's three years later and apparently, she's an ideal student! She's adjusted well, is polite, keeps to herself, works independently, gets her work done, is testing well, and the only complaint that the teacher could manage was that she wasn't keeping her desk tidy.

In our case nothing serious took place, thank God, because we listened to instinctual fear and removed ourselves from danger -- and I know that God's mighty angels were protecting us, as well. But don't you dare take it for granted that it could never happen to you. When you see a BEWARE OF DOG sign, you do exactly what the sign says. At the first hint of danger, you should do exactly what fear tells you to do, even if it seems irrational or unnecessary. Be aware of predators; be prudent; foresee the evil and hide yourself."

I was also informed that I shouldn’t be surprised that my tan-oaks are doing so poorly, since apparently – though they grow in a wide range of environments in our region – they grow almost exclusively on “native” soils (those derived directly from the bedrock underneath) and not on alluvium (or, by extension, the marine deposits I’m sitting on). I also should not expect my Oregon white oaks to do very well, since they’re more common somewhat inland. So much for acorns.

The CBO suggests that as many as 20 million workers could lose their employer-provided health insurance as a result of Obamacare. Instead, they will be dumped into government-run insurance exchanges. And, the recent dust-up over insurance coverage for contraceptives is a clear illustration of how the government will now be designing insurance plans for all of us. Regardless of how one feels about the contraceptive mandate itself, it is just the tip of the iceberg as government mandates tell employers what insurance they must provide, and tell us what insurance we must buy, even if that insurance is more expensive, contains benefits we don’t want, or violates our consciences."

To determine the meaning of a single verse, you must read the surrounding verses. Context is king.

The three points could equally be applied to Blackburn or any other side which should have been put to the sword but were not.

Politically, OWS will have to figure out if and how it can get the top 19%, many of whom identify with, aspire to be, and politically align with the top 1% (especially on issues of taxation and regulation) to choose a new form of political identity.

If we are paying that kind of money she is going to have to learn a different language and experience something far more unique than England. She is determined to go to England so she brings it up daily, each time with a new perspective for us to think about. We listen and then say Not. Gonna. Happen. But, last night she says, ""What if I work for the money and pay for it myself?"" Now, she has our attention."

That title made half the glitter fall off my horn, I can tell you!

But of course the reason he wants to be respected is that he’s not very respected at all. He wants to show everyone he can be trusted, but is patronised overlooked and humiliated on a regular basis. Impulse emotions in him are shame and humiliation and inadequacy. He feels this way because he idolises his dead father, and feels himself coming up short all the time."
"5467","As I briefly pondered if it was a wise choice to blow $40 on a book when I’m trying so hard to go paperless at home, I realized the tome was a little piece of inspiration to take home with me and representative of not just what I love about books, but what I love about the Met. Just as the Brothers Grimm discovered, there truly are stories all around us – some from the past, some of the moment and some to be created, but they are there for us to explore… or escape in — if we open ourselves up to them. Perhaps, beyond ancient scrolls and priceless works of art, this concept was the real takeaway from our day at the Met: go there and let your imagination take you wherever you want to go; clearly a lesson not just for a fifth grader."

"5492","The story was a little hard to get into, at first. But the chapters are really quick, and really short. They end on little cliffhangers a lot, and skip from character to character a great deal, which keeps you reading to find out what happens. Things start getting into some interesting twists about 1/5 – 1/4 of the way into the book. It keeps moving along at a good pace, but it doesn’t tire you out. The politics aren’t very dense. It’s more action-oriented. The characters are all very human, and tend to screw up sometimes."

However, each contestant required to perform while suffering from laryngitis. For some the laryngitis left them with rasping croaks reminiscent of the mating cries of the Natterjack Toad; for others the laryngitis left the contestant virtually silent and requiring to perform their blind auditions using the medium of interpretative dance or mime, while being cheered by a deluded whooping audience.

Students also have the things they read handed to them – it’s much harder for her to find the time to read things that the professors don’t want her to read – and she could never bring those things up in class safely anyway. A lot of people who thrive on being told that they are good prefer to stay in school where it is easy to just do whatever the teacher says in order to get good grades – especially in non-STEM fields like English."

My flight was to depart from DTW at 7:05 PM and arrive at 7:50 PM, but the email advised that my flight was to be delayed. The new scheduled departure time was now 8:35 PM with an arrival time of 9:10 PM. I looked at the email and reread it several times not quite understanding something about it. I mean I understood that the flight was delayed and I would be leaving later, but I think I could not wrap my mind around it because Southwest had never ever delayed a flight I was going to be on."

I was able to add one more hive this year, my original intention was to add 2 hives but sadly, my bees didn't survive the winter. It is very hard to keep bees in a hive alive through a Minnesota winter, esp like the one we had this past winter. I wasn't even able to get to my hives until the end of February, and even then the usual 5 minute walk took me like 20 minutes because every step was a struggle, I was hip deep in snow, and so I had to pull each leg out entirely to make the next step, it was truly exhausting! A great work out though... I thought I was going to have to give up before I even got to the hives though, I was just whipped! And quite disappointed to open that first hive and find a whole mess of dead bees in there. Then finding the same thing in the second was quite devastating. I knew I wasn't going to give up, but it did put quite a damper on any grand hive expansion I might have had in mind."

My closing, ""You can stop yelling at your children. Start by focusing on your relationships, letting go of your expectations and meeting the needs of each family member"" would have pushed my buttons when I was struggling through each day with three children ages 4 and under. I would have told you that all I did was meet my family's needs: laundry, dishes, cooking, nursing, and changing diapers. If you felt that way about the post, I hope you will go back to it and click on some of the links to past blogs. The past blogs go into more detail and explain what I meant by focusing on relationships, and to which expectations and needs I was referring."

Some people think that government is responsible to help the poor, others think that it is the job of the poor to somehow help themselves, and still others think that it is the responsibility of the individual to help the poor. The fact of the matter is that it is the job of the Church to provide for the poor.

From 1895-1900 he was in the Manhattan Comedy Four with Sam Curtis, Arthur Williams and Ed Mack of Harrigan and Hart’s old troup. The group sang songs like “Sweet Molly Moran” and “After the Ball” in four part harmony and did comedy sketches, many of them written by Shean.

By attempting to meet her romantic expectations he is also able to momentarily escape his own reality.

"5710","Its narrative genius is the surtitles, which flash up before each scene, describing the plot of the story, before the curtains rise on the stage, revealing another, altogether more mundane reality. It's a brilliant way of coping with the tale's anachronisms, which are mostly removed from the actual performances, and become instead a framing device. And this convention means that the dozen or so short plays or tableaux that make up the whole need not concern themselves at all with plot. When the curtains rise, we are suddenly pitched into 21st century Melbourne, into the unremarked spaces between larger, tragic events. What we see are overwhelmingly domestic scenes."

This series of races was highlighted by two things. One was a loss to Olympic Champion Justin Gatlin in Eugene which would mark the last time the two would go head to head – and Powell’s last head to head against a top rival outside of a major championship until 2008. And Powell’s first injury in what has become a recurring series of injuries every year since. This one kept him out of the World Championships in Helsinki, as the new WR holder watched as Olympic champion Gatlin added the World title to his resume."

"5838","Then they moved on, placing the baked goods in a plastic box in the fridge. They decided some fortune telling was in order, and, retrieving some paper, they made cootie catchers. They asked them lots of questions, and one of Qayte's could see the future. Once the dog had attempted to eat Qayte psychic fortune teller and they had grown bored trying to think of new questions, they decided to play a game of M.A.S.H. They wrote down their categories - where they'd live, what kind of house they'd have, how many kids they'd have, how much their salary would be, what their job would be, their car, and where they'd have their honeymoon (and of course, who their husband would be) - Cole chose two options for each category, and Qayte chose two. They were playing to see Cole's future, you see, so Cole chose one's she wanted, and Qayte chose one's Cole really didn't want particularly, thanks. Then they played, leaving Cole with a good mix of good things (husband, type of house, um..something) and bad things. Then they played for Qayte, which was hilarious. Really hilarious. But anyway, they had to get on AIM right that instant and inform Qayte's future husband of their discovery, which they did. Unfortunately, the future husband was idle, so they talked to....um...need a new name...Anna? Alice? could just use her name, I suppose...Abbi, instead, and they asked her if she wanted to play M.A.S.H. Once a little wikipedia had explained to her what it was, they had her choose her options, and they selected another option, one each. Abbi wound up with fairly Hi-larious results, which I can't recall. Meanwhile, the future husband got on, and he was informed of his role. This startled him, but it was all good. They also did M.A.S.H. for Kyra, which was funny, because she got Johnny Depp for a husband. They asked Qayte's future husband awkward questions, several of which he would not answer. They discussed his children, and how they wanted them. It was Cole's opinion that he should have, like, ninety kids, and fill up whole orphanages, so everyone could have his children. Then it was very late, so they went to bed, but Cole insisted on checking her Myspace first, which just goes to show you how low she had sunk."

"5910","Migrant and seasonal farmworkers are some of the lowest wage earners overall. The National Agricultural Workers Survey found the average annual income for a farmworker falls right around $10,000. For farmworker women, those numbers are likely even more appalling. AFOP members are doing their part to help break that mold. For example, one of our members in New Mexico, HELP-NM, is training farmworker women for jobs in innovative employment sectors such as solar energy. They are also training women for better-paying positions traditionally held by men within agriculture, such as tractor operators."

Or how the ""ruby red color, intense bouquet and well-structured flavor"" of the Vaona Valpolicella Ripasso 2007 might possibly enhance the richness of a butternut squash ravioli in a frangelico pecan brown butter sauce."

(The restaurant moved steadily northward over the years.) But my guess would be the final location, at Fifth Avenue and 44th Street—just ten blocks from Bill's. What's more, Delmonico's closed in 1923, one year before Bill's reportedly opened."
"5939","Fair enough. I have read a little of the wonders of quantum physics and the butterfly effect, and I agree with all that the report says about them, apart from the link to Astrology. “As above, so below”- a beautifully elegant quote, so expressive, and so completely wrongheaded. I love the acronym Great Organising Dynamic, even if I am not sure I agree, and find the expression attractive- even persuasive, had it been about anything else. The report says I belong to God: many Quakers actually put that into practice, but would disagree that God’s Will is expressed in an astrological chart. It states it is up to me: a Jupiter-Sun conjunct (where they appear close together) means optimism and vitality, but I have to realise them in my own life. Here, I begin to see a value in all this. I read good things about myself, feel better because of it, and then am told to go out and make them true."

The smell is dominant of dark fruits (plums and raisins) and caramel malt. I consider this a ""malty"" nose, and I like it on this cool fall evening. The flavor profile hits heavy with all of the caramel malt in the nose coming full force on the palate with other flavors or dark fruit, banana, and a spot of sweet molasses, but the alcohol in this offering also comes through in the flavor profile. The mouthfeel is full bodied with medium carbonation and a good shot of warming alcohol is present. The drinkability is very good on this beer, and I could have easily drank another one."

This is because the more support and funding provided the more an area, like Swansea, becomes a magnet for dossers, junkies, alkies, misfits and criminals. The bottom line is that - due to the Englandandwales framework in which our third sector operates - the better funded our third sector then the bigger the problems will become.

"5959","Lee’s choice to include narrations of different poems and other stories are a bit distracting, and manage to separate me from the story of how Paul Goodman was a life-changing inspiration, which certainly couldn’t have been the goal of these additions. Instead of these readings, I would have loved to learn more about some of Goodman’s specific interests, which are teased in the film. For example, Goodman created a proposal to ban cars from New York City. This is a fascinating and bold idea that could have easily been expanded upon in the documentary. The suggestion that Goodman makes that literacy is not necessary is another example of this. Lee spends around ten minutes on these proposals, which seem to be prime examples of Goodman’s radical thinking. It would be great, as someone who is new to Goodman, to get even more examples like this, exposing us to more of the way Goodman thought. His personal life is interesting, but what makes Goodman special is not that he loved sex, or acted as both mother and father to his daughter, it’s all those things plus these radical ideas and his outspoken nature that inspire countless strangers to declare that Paul Goodman did, in fact, change their lives."

I now step outside the hotel room. The hops makes it a slightly different experience for a wheat beer, and I can dig it. It definetly refreshes one at 95 degree heat. It still feels smooth, though no new flavors are coming out, save MAYBE a slight spiciness."

This is the king of buffets, which is going to make it polarizing. If you hate buffets, nothing about New China III is going to magically make you change your mind.

I was happy to introduce Greg to the Lo mein, and the array of flavored chickens was luke warm and super tasty. I didn’t have a salad, because I’m a fat guy, but it looked like something you might like if you don’t like maximizing the potential of an all you can eat buffet. They had one row of American foods, which was bizarre, complete with pizza, wings, Mac and cheese, etc. I didn’t try that. I stuck to authentic Chinese dishes like sushi.

Everyone is kind of doing their own thing, most are on their laptops or phones like me, others are doing work for other classes, some have stepped out early and of course the very few who are actually paying attention. This is the norm of an every day college class. Simple but consistent. But today someone decides to be the class clown. The professor is somewhat out there and makes statements that are kind of bold and quite frankly keeps the class somewhat interesting. This one kid decides to make that his platform to get his 3o seconds of fame. The first remark (did not care enough to actually listen to what the statement was) got a few laughs. The second, a little less. The third and fourth now is where the line needs to be drawn. Do you not notice the dwindling laughs and the growing quiet spreading through the room? People like this are not funny and are more disruptive than anything else. Stuff like this always bothers me because one would think common sense would inform them to cease their actions. Common sense it seems is becoming a scarce resource."

I always had that weird feeling when I looked at pictures of myself, as many people do- the person in photos feeling different from the person in the mirror, but that's easily explained. A picture is how other people see us, a mirror is a reverse image of our body.

Nonetheless, politically and artistically, it remains a museum piece. To put it charitably, Blitzstein was no Gershwin – neither a George nor an Ira. With the benefit of hindsight, The Cradle Will Rock reads like an attempt to graft Brecht and Weill’s daring theatrical innovations onto Clifford Odets’ homegrown agit-prop. The Fat Cat is our boogey-man here, and the answer is, what? Unions! But this is 2010, we know better than that, market crash notwithstanding. Not only are unions capable of corruption as heinous as any monopoly or cartel, but so are socialist governments. We may not like it when The Cradle’s cartoon villain Mr. Mister (Bill Newhall) buys off the church, the press, the arts and the medical and academic establishments…on the other hand, 73 years later, we also don’t like it when labor unions and big government push us around either.

A dead man who turns out to have been a private investigator who was following her. Enjoyable mystery, with amusing ending with overtones of slapstick comedy. I was particularly enjoying this mystery because Sophie and her sidekick do what is rare in amateur detective novels--they tell the police what they've found, or at least try to. I found it refreshing that Sophie didn't think she was smarter than the detective (to whom, of course, she's very attracted; ditto him to her). Until Sophie found the poison vial and instead of calling the police, decided--stupidly--to try to catch the killer (of several people) herself. Very out of character with a woman who, up til this point in the story, was acting like a normal person. Disappointed this reader. I know, you'll say the author needed this to resolve the mystery. Well, I liked Sophie a lot up til then, and I instantly lost respect for her acting stupid. Which made me forget forgiving her being wishy-washy and unable to tell Humphrey that no, they were not on a date, and no, they were not involved romantically (this relationship was too junior high to be believed) and get annoyed by that whole subplot. Enjoyable enough I'll give Sophie another try, but if this smart amateur detective suddenly has another stupid moment, I'll be mightily disappointed. Lots of food talk in this mystery, and it made me eager for Thanksgiving dinner."

He told me about his church, which does I believe infant and child baptisms along with renewal baptisms. Something like that. What I take about the renewal baptism (which they offer at my dad’s church at least three times a year (Easter being one that’s required)) is that it’s reconfirming that you believe in Jesus dying to save you from your sins. I guess if I ever got baptized again, it would be more like a public confession of my belief in Jesus Christ, my Savior."

Ollie’s brain tried to say ‘Er, ‘scuse me, what’s going on?’ but his mouth had lost its way and just opened and shut itself, like a goldfish. His mother was a storm trooper and he was on the Tardis. Ollie began to think taking notice of the use-by date on jars of fish paste might be an idea. Especially if they came from his dotty aunt’s Yellow Stone Super Volcano Emergency stash."

Their goal is to avoid addressing any unpredictability in the game, keep the ball out of play for as long as possible and reduce it to a series of short bursts of action. In these situations the manager can have more input, through strategies set out on the training ground and learned by rote – he won’t have to rely so much on the decision-making of his players. It might sound uninspiring, but it tends to work. It’s nothing to moan about – this is the reality of the situation and something to overcome."

The State makes its mark-up on wine and spirits; why not have the State sell everything, then, from groceries to fishing rods?

Anyway, unbeknownst to me before we started the adoption journey, having your child escorted home--as opposed to traveling to South Korea to pick up your child--is highly controversial. It is one of those Korean-adoption hot topics. (Who knew?) I was (and still am) quite surprised at some of the things I read about folks' feelings regarding escorting.

It's hard to imagine GBT Joe pounding anything too hard, since it's common knowledge that he'd much rather be the poundee. The poundee of an entire rugby team. After being denied access to his own home for a substantial amount of time, Joseph called his father. Unfortunately, his father's best advice was to wait outside for his mother to calm down. GBT Joe pointed out that if his mother had had all night to calm down and hadn't by now, things weren't looking good. Having stood outside his house for over an hour, without any sign of his mother, or his father's spine, GBT finally lost the proverbial plot."

The extra cost in the South East represents the extra embedded rent, to give us a true figure for wages net of pure rents and net of embedded rents.

On the inside, however, the place was reinforced with girders and beams. Pieces of sheet metal sat between the thick metal shafts and the exterior wall, with holes cut to accommodate the windows.

"6206","When I write my mysteries set in ancient Rome, I like to use artefacts as clues. To come up with ideas for these clues, I play with replica artefacts made for me by my re-enactor friends. Occasionally I use the real thing; like the 2000 year old oil-lamp I used to take around to schools with me. I once filled it with olive oil, put in a wick and lit it. You'd think a little piece of string would burn up in a few seconds. But not if it's soaking in olive oil. Then it will burn and burn. When the oil begins to fail the flame flickers and grows smaller, but all you have to do is top up the lamp with oil and the flame burns brighter. Sadly, wear and tear took their toll on my Romano-Egyptian oil-lamp so I use modern replicas when I go to schools and festivals, like this oil-lamp (from the British Museum) with a four-horse chariot design. Today, if you go to a football game you might come home with a souvenir mug. In Roman times, if you spent a day at the Circus Maximus, you would buy a souvenir oil-lamp, daubed with the colours of your team: red, white, green or blue."

The children of Mbari begged the army of Chief Mutema to help them to fight against Chiweshe. Chief Mutema agreed and he called many people to fight against Chiweshe. Chiweshe when he heard that was afraid and he told his son-in-law Mhembere. Mhembere told Chiweshe to call his people. When they were gathered Mhembere took the medicine from his gona and mixed it with porridge and gave it to Chiweshe and his people. Then Mhembere took the medicine from his gona and put it in the fire saying, “if we go to fight Chief Mutema are we going to conquer him?” He threw the medicine into the fire and the smoke pointed to Chief Mutema. Mhembere said to Chiweshe, ‘Let us go and fight against Chief Mutema for we are going to conquer him.” Then Mhembere led Chiweshe and his people to fight Chief Mutema. When they met they fought on a hill called Tsikwi (Avondale). Chief Mutema was killed with a spear by Mhembere and many of his people were killed and some ran away."

Working with an editor is a chance to learn wonderful things about the craft of writing in general and your own strengths and weaknesses in particular.

For this assignment I chose an Abercrombie & Fitch Billboard from a few years back that I found on a “daily billboard” blog. Originally I was going to go with a provocative perfume ad that is sold at some department store like Macy’s, but after a boost I chose to focus on Abercrombie & Fitch. Correct me if I’m wrong, but I think that A&F sells sex and desire better than Victoria’s Secret (at least for my generation). I remember vividly when I first heard about the A&F Quarterly magazine. A family friends daughter, who was about 18 and very fond of A&F, was a part of their mailing list and received this “catalog” in the mail. Her mother said, as all mothers did, “They are a clothing company and they don’t have any clothes on!”. Although I may not particularly agree with the tactics of a company that advertises to pre-teens using nudity as their main selling point, you’ve gotta hand it to them- they got people talking and mothers upset. And everyone knows what happens when you tell a kid not to shop somewhere (…they do it anyway! and A&F makes millions)."

There’s at least one every semester, and you find yourself studying for it a little more than the others, even despite the fact that you know, deep in the pit of your stomach, with every fiber of your soul, that you need to study for EVERYTHING in university unless you want it to eat you alive. Clearly, as the good university or college student you are, you limit your partying or whatever else you like to do during exams week, and you study for the God forsaken things – but sometimes you study too much for the exams you think you’re going to get shitty grades in, end up passing those with flying colors, and bomb the easy insert-best-subject-here exam you thought you were guaranteed an A+ in."

Bergman has been working for a while and has two modes of painting that have clashed in this show. One is a dada meats Agnes Martin style where she acquires abondoned paintings at thrifts stores and turns them into faces. But the process of living with them, sometimes for years, and waiting for a moment of clarity is in touch with poetic Minimalism. When the image reveals itself a few deft brushtrokes bring it out. The other style is wild and crazy. Loose and violent, but also lighthearted and funny. These paintings come out of nowhere, but click right-on with a lot of what is going on in contemporary art."

He thinks it is fun when we show him what things look like. Just recently he is trying to draw specific things, like animals, cars and people, which is really cute. He always loves explaining, in explicit detail what he is drawing haha. He is really sweet too because he likes to draw or make things for other people.

This creates the illusion of unified, universal support for the “denormalization” of smoking and of smokers.

I think and reflect first–often for a while–and only after thoughts are collected and organized–are they then written in what is a fairly permanent and enduring form. For extraverts–this might be different… or maybe not. I know that for me–writing is very similar to talking–I almost never do either without first thinking exactly about what I want to express–whereas I know a number of extraverts who quite often use speech and talking with others as a way of doing their thinking/processing–because, for them, the external world is the primary reality–and thus–to make a thought real, it has to appear in this external world. Just thinking about it internally doesn’t seem as real to them…"

Lack of communication over large land areas, the development of the city (city-state), and the need to make laws and create ways of assuring the city both protected and preserved its inhabitants. From its very inception however, the problem arises as to who is to make these rules and other decisions. Obviously there were those who considered themselves to be more worthy of the duty of “governing” (and possibly were), but then this leaves the rest of the population at the mercy of the beginning of what we would call today the “elite class”. This class is usually not only better educated, but has a greater leadership capacity, and think in more abstract ways. These qualities however, do not necessarily assure a public official with the good of society as their goal. Therefore, with the rise of the ruling class, we can see the beginning of the manipulation of power, and the precursor to the aristocracy that was created by the monarchy."

The hedgehog spends his summer in the garden, and hibernates comfortably in the museum. The bees at work in the glass hive are another source of instruction.

Just breathe and feel! Release and allow the child of the heart to dance in the field of wonderment that surrounds and enfolds us at all times! If there is any heaviness or dark mood, allow yourselves to feel the “structure” or “geometry” of any tightness or pain associated with it in the body and then give deep permission to move and breathe, dance and tone in ways that helps to “evolve” your relationship with it."
"6375","As I listened to her and politely told her I wasn't asking for her advice on diet, it dawned on me why I dislike most doctors. They base everything on research and their status as ""experts"" rather than inquiring about how the patient feels and what we think. They assume we have nothing to contribute. This reminds me so much of how schoools are run. The curriculum is based on ""research"" and the teacher being the ""expert"" rather than getting feedback from the unique group of students being taught. When I see my naturopath, she asks me questions like ""eating this way, how would you rate how you feel?"" She might even say, ""You read a lot, what do you think is best for you?"" She encourages me to listen to my body and take an active role in my recovery."

I find that this novel hasn't changed my mind about Philippa Gregory's writing - I consider it rather tired at times, and end up skimming pages. Having said all this, the cliff-hanger ending of The White Queen will make me pick up The Red Queen, and I'm interested to see whether Gregory can achieve the tough objective of writing the same period from a completely different voice."

"6388","In place of the former Spring (old signage still up) , this modern little rotisserie serves up a simple menu composed of good quality products. This evening: roast chicken (the rare coucou de Rennes, no less), complemented by apples and roast potatoes in goose fat, and a mushroom salad with grenadines, followed by pears with honey, pear cake and pear compote with creme fraiche and chocolate. The idea is not to do another Spring, but rather a remote-controlled, Rose consulted menu that will appeal to neighbors (ie take out) as much as clued-up, jetsetting diners, with another chef behind the oven (leaving Rose to continue his other projects). The entire meal tonight was prepared by Daniel, who wasn't actually supposed to be there, and we counted ourselves as the lucky few, as this will not be a likely occurrence in the future. Again, this is not Spring II, but a simple place for a good meal, early or late, without spending a fortune. Menus are 29€ or 34€, whether you order a quarter or a half chicken."
"6389","The ineffective Ji-sung Park was replaced with Danny Welbeck 12 minutes into the second half in the hope of finding an equaliser, but neither him nor the later additions of Valencia or Young added any real creativity to United’s display. Alex Ferguson’s frustration was illustrated in his touchline spat with Roberto Mancini with around ten minutes remaining, and the two had to be separated as tempers flared. United struggled to exert any real pressure on Joe Hart’s goal, and the match ended without them registering a single shot on target for the first time since a 0-0 draw with Arsenal at Old Trafford in 2009. The final whistle was greeted with scenes of jubilation from those associated with the blue side of Manchester, and left City with the prospect of becoming the fifth team to claim the Premiership crown."

It took me all year, and it was pretty terrible. But when I finished, I wrote another book and another and another. During my senior year, after I'd finished a fantasy novel, I went to a writing conference and pitched an agent. But I was too sensitive and I didn't really know anything about the industry, and it didn't go well. I left the conference thinking that publishing wasn't for me. I knew I would always write, but I figured I wouldn't really pursue being published. I wrote consistently after that but never really showed my writing to anyone. Then a year and a half ago I started writing Unraveling and joined a writing group for fun. They really loved it and encouraged me to let an agent take a look."

Thankfully, the band admits that it still retains the driving charm that the original had and it also includes some gorgeous lead vocals. These feminine sounds prove a refreshing diversion because the remainder of the cuts are led by Ballantyne whose tones can sit anywhere along the scale of harmonious and pleasant to plain androgynous, although in “I Don’t Wanna” they also seem rather whiny. “Packin’ For Paris” also boasts some great vocal work with some smile-inducing acrobatics reaching up for the sky making the effort sound like it was made by a sixties vocal group.

It seems like every rom-com lately has started to fall into this path where they aren’t just about being a funny, romantic movie, but they also have to have a huge deal of drama in it too, just so it can even things out. The film seems very disjointed in parts, as it was more just a bunch of sketches put together, but they were still funny enough to hold me over and get past it. But by last couple of acts where the film shows Violet and Tom’s relationship starting to crumble down, the film starts to get a bit darker and focus more on the sadness these two have away from each other, rather than focus on some cool moments of comedy. It’s actually a big downer when these two aren’t together because not only does it take a lot of steam out of the comedy, but the idea of these two being perfect for each other is uprooted as well."

The growing truth that is set forth in this book is that though we need to gospel to get saved we need it just as much after we are saved.

She was from a small town ten miles from mine and used to trumpet the fact that she and her younger brother had been adopted. “Chosen” she called it. She let on that her parents shuttled her and her brother off to an endless series of camps over the summer. Basically, they spent the entire summer away from home while their parents traveled around. Terri Jo was loud and rambunctious, and always tried a bit too hard to fit in. But my friends and I decided not to let her."

This post really isn’t about that, I promise (though of course we’ll have to start there). What this is about is me sizing up for myself whether I’m “Mom Enough,” or really, even, what kind of Mom I might be. I’ve been engaging in the same mental inventory of my Mommyhood that I suspect many of us have done in the past days — not because I feel insecure about my parenting, but because there has been so much discussion of all different kinds of parenting choices that it just seemed like a moment where an intellectually curious person like myself ought to stop and take stock."

As much as I have read many critics accuse Scorsese's ""The Departed"" of being a sell-out project where he provided a more commercially-acceptable version of his previous gangster sagas, I have to say that Scorsese's chasing of trends, particularly in ""The Aviator"" and now ""Shutter Island"" bothers me more. ""The Aviator"" contains some of his most impersonal filmmaking, a trendy by-the-numbers biopic with a CGI-aided glossy aesthetic housed in a self-important shell as Oscar bait that I could not honestly differentiate from the works of Ron Howard. It seemed like Scorsese wanted to convey the beauty of flying because he felt the audiences would lap up the ride, even if his direction demonstrated that he had no understanding of what that experience truly feels like. This was a grounded filmmaker trying to convince us that he had wings."

Take time everyday to notice what is happening inside your body and your mind so that you notice any small changes and you will be well on your way to bringing wonderful insight to your health. The practice of Yoga is wonderful for helping us connect with our bodies. When a small part of the day is dedicated to paying attention to the details and workings of our body we become more in tune with it. If something changes we are more quick to pick up any change in the body thus hopefully avoiding major breakdowns. Yoga increases body consciousness. Yoga also helps us to confront things that in the past we may have had the attitude of “out of sight, out of mind.” With Yoga you tune in and the outcome is healing and health!"

If it doesn’t and you still can’t get your GP to listen to you, write them a letter clearly outlining your symptoms and why you are concerned and if you don’t feel that you can do it yourself get a friend or family member to help you. That way, if there is something really wrong with you and they miss it, you have evidence that you informed them and it will help if you end up needing to claim compensation."

If I can have a winter run time even close to my summer times, then this summer meeting that 20 minutes 5k goal should prove quite plausible."

Some days ago the nurses had pushed him elsewhere, without giving any reasons. To some other place. The abrupt division of the final sentence, which we must assume is a feature of the German original, mimics the pauses in speech; an aural semi-colon adding a peculiar stress to the banality of the information it contains.

"6697","The inbreeding coefficient of the Spanish Habsburg kings increased strongly along generations from 0.025 for king Philip I, the founder of the dynasty, to 0.254 for Charles II and several members of the dynasty had inbreeding coefficients higher than 0.20. In addition to inbreeding due to unions between close relatives, ancestral inbreeding from multiple remote ancestors makes a substantial contribution to the inbreeding coefficient of most kings. A statistically significant inbreeding depression for survival to 10 years is detected in the progenies of the Spanish Habsburg kings. The results indicate that inbreeding at the level of first cousin (F = 0.0625) exerted an adverse effect on survival of 17.8% 612.3. It is speculated that the simultaneous occurrence in Charles II (F = 0.254) of two different genetic disorders: combined pituitary hormone deficiency and distal renal tubular acidosis, determined by recessive alleles at two unlinked loci, could explain most of the complex clinical profile of this king, including his impotence/infertility which in last instance led to the extinction of the dynasty."

"6800","Being that the kids came to live with us in November 2008 we missed Halloween. So these pictures are of the first Halloween that we got to spend with them. Both Kam and Jasey had very definite ideas of who they wanted to dress as. At the time Kam was entranced with the Snow White movie so she of course wanted to be Snow White. Jase is crazy for two movies, Cars and Toy Story - he wanted to be Lighting McQueen but the costumes were horrible so we talked up Buzz Lightyear and he went for it. They were so excited getting dressed and preparing to go out ... I'm not sure but I believe it might have been the first time they ever went trick or treating. It was a special day for ALL of us."

I got her out as the last thing I did before I ran to catch my bus."

Which leads me to believe that those around you see you as strong and energetic. This could be why you're getting pressure people expect great things for you and want to see you moving toward goals. This card could also be how you're feeling. Making money does not mean 9 to 5 and I think you're well aware of that."
"6804","I think I mentioned this before, but I'm somewhat of a celebrity at my doctor's office. Apparently, its pretty rare to show up to the hospital with the baby nearly falling out of your girly bits, but that's exactly how things went with my firstborn. I had planned to have an epidural and everything. I figured, why be in pain? I wouldn't have my appendix removed without some sort of pain killer...why remove a baby in agony? However, my plan to be all happy and giggles during delivery didn't work out quite that way. But to be honest, I was glad to go au natural. I even told my husband afterward that I enjoyed labor and delivery, pain and all. I know it sounds like I'm completely mental, but unless its experienced, one can never understand the miracle of giving birth. And I don't use miracle lightly. The whole thing is just absolutely mind blowing. So, the second time around, I informed the doctor that I didn't want to have an epidural. I told them that if things went as smoothly as the first time, I preferred to deliver my child at warp speed and in total torture. They already believed me to be completely crazy so it didn't phase them one bit. They merely said ""One baby, massive misery, pure pain, you got it."""

"6836","The look must be given some forgiveness because it came out in 1958, but it didn’t really work for me either. The fly was basically just a real fly with nail polish on its head, the human fly looked a little like a fly, but was more cute than scary, and the science-y stuff was what you would expect out of a 50’s movie. Their policy was mainly just to get as many flashing lights and multicolored neon tubes, and play some Theremin noises. I don’t know how a reel to reel player would help a teleportation machine, but they had their idea for how it would happen, I guess. But the looks of the two flies got on my nerves, not for the production of them, but for the idea of them. In the remake of the movie, they were combined on a cellular level by the machine. This seems somehow logical. In the original, the fly and the scientist exchange heads and one arm. This would be fine if the movie ended right at this point because the fly with the giant head and arm and the human with a tiny and nearly invisible head and arm would both die immediately, solving the problem. Instead of going that way, the machine decided that the basic shape and design of the head was the important part to duplicate, not so much the size. And with their brains being exchanged as well, it probably wouldn’t have fit in the head of the fly. I never really got behind the idea of the fly’s instincts taking over Andre either, mainly because it only seemed to manifest itself as the fly fucking with the rest of him, like grabbing his arm when he was trying to type. I half expected it to take his arm and start doing the whole “Quit hitting yourself” thing to him."

"6908","There, amongst many other things, Flannery explains what it means to be a quote-unquote ""hunter-gatherer"" vs. a sedentary agricultural society. He writes, for instance, that ""the problem of defining just what constitutes agriculture is an acute one when examining the prehistory of New Guinea.""Traditionally, the major crops of the region have been root crops such as taro, or suckering species such as bananas. In order to propagate these plants one simply needs to grub them up, cut off the tuber or sucker and stick the leafy top back into the ground. This simple act has probably been a part of the human behavioral repertoire for 100,000 years or more. Clearly it does not qualify a person as an agriculturalist. But what is to be said of the person who returns to the newly established plant occasionally and clears competing species (weeds) away from it? And what if they plant 10 taro tops together; does that qualify as a garden? Would it do so if they fenced the patch? Clearly the definition of agriculturalist merges insensibly into the definition of hunter-gatherer and it is impossible to say where one ends and the other begins.This mobile cultivation of the landscape actually helped to generate, as Flannery goes on to explain, a substantial part of our contemporary, highly globalized fruit diet. Indeed, he writes, ""Given the extremely long history of agriculture in New Guinea, it is not surprising that a number of plant foods appear to have originated there. Among these are certain varieties of taro, sago, some kinds of yams, bananas (particularly the cooking or plantain varieties), sugar cane and various nuts. Some of these crops were adopted by people as far afield as Africa, Asia and the Pacific Islands many hundreds of years before European colonization of the Pacific. New Guinean agriculture has thus made an important, if largely forgotten, contribution to the food crops of the world."""

I'm a romantic at heart, and drawn to all kinds of anachronisms, and to me, The Vespertine was a book that, wonderfully, and amazingly, just didn't fit in, didn't quite belong amidst all the other young adult books I was reading, and that's a huge part of why I loved Saundra's book and her ethereal writing style quite so much. I've recommended The Vespertine to so many people and talked extensively about it here, so when I received a copy of The Springsweet for an ARC tour, I was thrilled and elated, and I also had high hopes for the sequel to The Vespertine, it being Zora Stewart's story. The Springsweet picks up right at a year after the events of The Vespertine, and it's not a lie to say that when I read the opening passages, I felt like I'd come home, back to Saundra's beautiful writing."

"6919","He endured the season and though no one told him when the reporting day was for the next season, Brown showed up. Aside from finding a friend or two, Brown was treated the same in season two that he had been in season one. During practice in season two, Brown sustained serious hand and knee injuries for which he was offered no attention from the trainers or medical staff. He had to limp off the field by himself and drag himself to the student infirmary to receive care. That was that for Brown’s football playing days at the University of Arkansas. But it was his injuries, not his guts or a lack of determination, that kept him from returning to the field. Brown’s attempt to be a one-man integration movement for southern college football was over."

"6921","I've gone through a wide range of rucksack options over nearly two decades. I started with the ALICE large ruck and frame, as a young Ranger, moved on to a civilian mountaineering rucksack courtesy of Dana Designs, as a SF NCO, then tried a couple of different high-end military rucksack systems from the commercial market before reverting to the ""big green tick"" of my youth. The ALICE pack is not ideal for anyone, and is simply unbearable for most. I accept that reality, and seldom, if ever, recommend it, unless someone is on a budget (and often not even then. Kelty makes some extremely durable, large-capacity internal frame packs that are not much more expensive than a surplus ALICE ruck, while being far more comfortable for most people to carry). Nevertheless, my body long ago developed the necessary contortions to carry an extremely heavy ALICE ruck and still remain tolerably comfortable doing so (at least as ""comfortable"" as a ""gut-check"" can ever be). It works for ME."
"6922","This is a question which we can never really know the answer too, because we cannot read the minds of believers, but we can take a pretty good guess.

Anyways, so I made this layout to try to catch up with some stuff from my daughters earlier months and also to remind me that the nice weather does come. It was inspired by some challenges that are involved with the crop out for a cure for Diabetes. One of the challenges was to create something that celebrates spring. And the other challenge was to create something about someone that inspires you. So I created it for my daughter because she has inspired me to remember to stay young at heart, and to always laugh and be happy."

Luckily I have cleaned my act before she will have any memory of it. The sad thing is is I bet I will say this in another five years. The thing is, the more you learn and read, the more you realize how little you know. Maybe it'd be better to blindly raise children without any psychological knowledge. I have this things for parenting books. Probably because of their psychology base, which I love, psychology. Now if only I could implement what I know. In the heat of the moment, it's a little hard though. But baby steps. Keep trying, keep learning, keep implementing as best you can. Just do what you can do."

It's the bird, although I think one can safely assume the band is also not radioactive. Story: Adult muttonbirds migrate to the North Pacific. Last year when they got there they fed in the seas off the east coast of Japan, and due to fallout from the Fukushima-Daiichi nuclear plant, ingested radioactive cesium isotopes. Then they came back to NZ and had baby muttonbirds, which people go and hunt, because they are delicious. (These people are referred to as 'muttonbirders' and they go 'muttonbirding', which is why ""The Deer Hunter"" was a terrible title for a movie.) Because of the concern, the Department of Conservation caught 30 pre-season muttonbirds, prepared them as if they were about to be eaten, and tested them for radioactivity. They were not radioactive. And that is what I do at work."

I'm not happy about it, really. I miss seeing him during the day and it makes me wonder where I fit into his life if I'm asleep for much of the waking portion of it. Still, I let him make his own choices. If he's not feeling well or of he's very tired you can bet I ask him if he thinks he got enough sleep (not all the time and not in an accusing way, but sometimes I just can't stop myself because I want him to be aware of how and if his sleeping patterns are affecting him). Anyway, I was thinking about the whole bedtime thing and I realized that this is the time in Jerry's life when it's natural for him to seek out independence–to move away from his parents in some ways. And what better place to do that than in our own home? He gets the entire house to himself. He's free to make choices without taking anyone else into consideration. And yet, if something happens that he wants to talk to me about (and that's not uncommon) all he has to do is walk downstairs and wake me up. It's the perfect situation, really. He's safe, but solo. And he gets the added bonus of being able to talk to friends who live in different time zones and might not be available during the day. So, I'm not saying I'm entirely happy with the situation, but I understand it. And I understand that there are benefits. So, I let it be."

I got frustrated and was dealing with some depression over the whole TTC thing and this blog definitely suffered. My apologies for the silence. I’m usually a pretty glass-half-full kinda gal but a lot of perceived rejection can bring you down a bit. I still tweeted about our experiences sporadically, but I hope to be getting back to it here more regularly from now on. It’s much easier to convey what’s going on.

The children of Ned Stark are equally divided: His oldest son, Robb, is leading an army as the King of the North; Sansa is locked away at King's Landing and still betrothed to the evil Joffery Lannister; Asha is posing as an orphan boy and on the run from the Lannisters; Jon Snow, the bastard son, is becoming an invaluable member of the Night Watch; and the crippled Bran and young Rickon are holding Winterfell."
"7063","As soon as I had got clear of the town I fell in with a poor woman walking at the same rate with myself and going the same course. Wishing to know the condition of the laboring poor I entered into conversation with her, which I began by enquiries for the path which would lead me to the mountain: and thence proceeded to enquiries into her vocation, condition and circumstances. She told me she was a day laborer at 8 sous or 4d. sterling the day: that she had two children to maintain, and to pay a rent of 30 livres for her house (which would consume the hire of 75 days), that often she could get no employment and of course was without bread. as we had walked together near a mile and she had so far served me as a guide, I gave her, on parting, 24 sous. She burst into tears of gratitude which I could perceive was unfeigned because she was unable to utter a word. She had probably never before received so great an aid. This little attendrissement, with the solitude of my walk, led me into a train of reflections on that unequal division of property which occasions the numberless instances of wretchedness which I had observed in"

"7070","That a Leftist party can give birth to conservative thinking is probably most clearly seen in the Australian case. Neville Wran, a Queen's Counsel of working class origins, was Labor party Premier of Australia's most populous state (New South Wales) from 1976 to 1986 and during his tenure introduced his party to conservatism (though not under that name of course). The electoral success of his approach was noted on the Federal level and was put into practice on the Federal level with the accession to power of Bob Hawke. Prior to his career in Parliament, Hawke was known as the king of compromises in the field of disputes between unions and business. As Prime Minster (1983-1981) he of course continued that approach and was in addition remarkably pragmatic on economic matters -- largely traceable, no doubt, to his degree in economics. It was he who initiated large scale privatizations of government enterprises in Australia -- very much akin to what Margaret Thatcher did in England."

"7140","Beyond that, one must challenge Bauckham’s idea that a ‘testament’ was “transparent fiction”. If the genre dates back to Moses, did any Jews think that Moses’ own farewell speech was pseudepigraphal or “transparent fiction”? The early church either wasn’t confident of the authorship or 2 Peter or assigned the letter to Peter. Apparently nobody in the first 17 centuries recognized the obvious ‘transparent fiction’ of 2 Peter.[88] Instead, Peter calls 2 Peter “a letter” (3:1) and there is not sufficient reason to overthrow this classification.[89]"

"7145","So, it seems, your pension – the sum you get each month in retirement (as calculated on page 9 of the USS leaflet) – will in fact be made up of two parts. One part which will rise each year in line with CPI, and another part which won’t fully. The second part will rise in line with CPI up to 5%, but after that, anything above 5% will only rise by half as much. So, 6% CPI will see a rise of 5.5% in your pension (5% plus half of 1%) and a 7% rise in CPI will see a 6% rise in your pension (5% plus half of 2%). What it doesn’t mention is that 15% is the ‘hard cap’. If CPI goes above 15%, you will not get anything more than a 10% increase to your pension (5% plus half of 10%)."

"7191","Quick, in what year is this movie set? Hard isn’t it? Could be 1927, could be forty years later. It is 1959, Welton’s centennial. 1959 is an interesting choice; a few years earlier and the 1960s, which Keating some sort of harbinger of, would seem too far away. A few years later, and the boys’ initial conformity would seem unbelievably square. So really, this is a story that seems sort of out of time, but really it’s hard to imagine it happening in any other year."

The castle was eventually replaced by an old warehouse, which offered space and parking, and didn’t seem to cramp Curious George’s style–just like kids, he’s curious anywhere. For a while, a children’s branch anchored a shopping center. And Tuesday mornings in summer, I peddled my pink Schwinn to Rose Park to meet the bookmobile, emptied my twin bike baskets, and filled them up again. The ride home was uphill, but my excitement made the ride easier."

It is really a worthwhile venture even though we never break $200 and I always work myself up with stress and dread before the event. Since it is right on town hall property, it gets plenty of traffic."

What they are not doing is manning a register. It becomes apparent the one cashier is new. Also slow. But very cheerful giving her full attention to each customer and concentrating on the process of each checkout. When I am the next one up another cashier opens a register and those behind me flee to that line. I was boxed in and could not possibly have responded when she called out ""I can help the next person !""."

During Lutfur Rahman's tenure as Leader of Tower Hamlets Council he gave £3million in local tax payers money to the East London Mosque to fund the building of the enormous ""London Muslim Centre"" where the IFE is now based. He also gave half a million to the Osmani Trust, a group that wants to take ""ex gang leaders"" off the streets and turn them into people who can, among other things, enforce Sharia Law amongst the local population; Muslim and non-Muslim alike. Great, so local thugs used to knifing people in the park will now be trained to patrol the streets telling women to wear a burha and all this is paid for by me, a local taxpayer. O super."

He might even be wearing a green shirt, and socks that eat his legs. But I'm not pushing my luck. I'm just really glad we're on the VIP team, because every single parent and coach knows this battle and will sympathize rather than criticize. This world of kids that are a little bit different, but really can play soccer, is one you have to live to fully understand. Its full of acceptance, and tolerance, and love. And we're all here to support and encourage each other, because we know that next week, it'll most likely be someone else's kid, and there's nothing we can do about that either."

"7208","Because on the basis of last night, they are. United failed in so many ways last night, not least of all team selection. Ji-Sung Park’s inclusion in big clashes isn’t irregular, but the South Korean’s impact was significantly blunted by his lack of match sharpness. Antonio Valencia was restricted to a ten minute cameo as the game was slipping away, a truly baffling decision considering how much of United’s attacking play has been reliant on the Ecuadorian of late. As such, United’s biggest talisman was left up front, alone and unable to provide any sort of spark. Wayne Rooney has had to grow accustomed to his manager’s insistence on adopting a 4-5-1 formation in the season’s biggest matches, and whilst his frustration didn’t truly boil over, his performance was almost futile considering just how rarely United managed to get the ball to him in a dangerous position. As reliable as Paul Scholes has been since his surprise return in January, both he and Ryan Giggs had disappointingly ineffectual evenings, and, even more worryingly, no one stepped up in their stead. It’s been noted enough times this season that Ferguson is currently in charge of a team that isn’t always capable of rising to the occasion, but last night’s performance, in a local derby no less, must act as a numbing and humbling notice to the club that when things do go wrong, a Plan B simply isn’t there, especially if Rooney is left this isolated and unsupported."

"7241","George Orwell grasped the political importance of nonsense long ago, in his still scary satire, Nineteen Eighty-Four. He referred to it as Duckspeak. The essence of Duckspeak is to lower the intellectual level of the conversation, spread confusion and allow the speaker to get away with something. Duckspeak was a refined version of the official language of Oceania, Newspeak. A good Duckspeaker could change his party line in mid-sentence while being quite unaware that the second half of the sentence contradicted everything in the first half. This ability was very much valued by the ruling Party. Newspeak was specifically designed to eliminate independent thought, and was essentially an impoverished version of the English language. “Newspeak was designed not to extend but to diminish the range of thought.”"

Very rarely there appears inside novels a finely drawn map of a literature-loving self and its relationship with the world. Aamer Hussein's The Cloud Messenger is one such book."

Combine Hofstadter’s perspective with that of Carl Marx and the reason the modern university is turning into a worker drone factory is because the capitalistic nature of society requires that it be stocked with young bodies born to be worker bees. Thinking this way, the occupy wall street movement and the student backlash against unemployement, is really a frustration that the almighty system has no place for your type of worker bee. When in reality it has no place for you because it has no place for thought anymore."

This Palestinian Jewish teaching form appears in the New Testament only in the teaching of Jesus, and thus cannot be attributed to composition by the later church outside Jewish Palestine.” (81-82)"

Guru Nanak's anti-communalist position flows directly from this theological stance on God and man. More specifically, Sikhs are instructed to transcend and merge their souls directly with God. This is done specifically to allow themselves to rise above their egos in order to escape from vanity and ‘repetitive reincarnation’. However, there is never a complete identity between God and the individual Sikh. The soul of the Sikh is thought to retain its identity. That is, the Sikh and God are never ‘ontologically identical’."

It was in England also, Mulcahy says, that Terpil asked him if he wanted to earn $5,000 on his return flight to Washington by detouring to Cairo to deliver a ”cold gun,” one with no identifying serial number. Mulcahy refused to deliver the weapon, but did learn months later that Qaddafi had provided Terpil and Wilson with a $1 million contract to assassinate Umar Abdullah Muhayshi, a Libyan defector who had plotted to overthrow Qaddafi’s regime. The assassination assignment had been subcontracted by Wilson to three anti-Castro Cubans in Miami with whom he had once worked in the C.I.A. ”Frank was playing both ends against the middle,” Mulcahy recalls. ”He was setting up an elaborate security system for the guy in Egypt to protect him while at the same time trying to bump him off.” Mulcahy and Terpil got along well and the two men exchanged many confidences during their trips together. ”Frank tends to talk a lot; he likes to name-drop,” Mulcahy says. ”What charges Frank’s batteries is the thrill of the chase, the excitement, being on the periphery of power. He thrives on it.” In time, Mulcahy said, he came to realize that there was more truth in Terpil’s seemingly wild stories than he had thought."

I didn't have design paper that I liked so I made my own background to go with the colors in the main image.The fluid chalk inks work great with a technique that I learned in an Impression Obsession class. These inks stay wet long enough for this technique to work really well. The doily was cut from some olive green lightweight paper, and a Cheery Lynn Doily (French Pastry-CLD-DL-102) was used & popped up. The main image (also popped up) has only a Magenta name on it, number 3F-154-J. I used Ranger Distress Bundled Sage to ink it; then used Faber Castell Big Brush pens, May Green, Chromium Green Opaque on the greenery - direct to rubber- and Magenta on the flower part. Spritzed this with misted water, then stamped. I used a Spellbinders Deckled Edge Classic Ovals Lg, #4, to cut & emboss the image, which was stamped on natural color Neenah cardstock. Then I decided to stamp a script stamp (sorry, forgot to write this one down!) inked with Antique Linen distress ink to stamp over it. I used Jill Foster's technique of wiping off part of the ink from this stamp, stamped over the flower image. The sentiment was a Hero Arts clear set (CL-272). I used just a portion of the entire stamp, as I've learned you can cut apart the clear set and it doesn't hurt anything. The purple borders were cut with SU Lace Ribbon Border punch, and I tried to complement the colors of the image and background colors. It's much prettier in real life (IRL!), but I'm still experimenting with the scanner & camera settings. I probably overdid the supply list, but I really am trying to get better with listing what I used. Hope you like it. Thanks for stopping in to visit. Have a great day."

"7431","Another theme An Na dealt with, albeit with less (imo) success, is her duality on what others want versus what the self wants. In this story, Mina, who has always lived for others, is starting to confront the things she wants for herself. Usually when this kind of theme pops up we are often told that what the Self wants is far more important than the considerations of others, and it’s all very tidy and clean and simply portrayed. This is not a motif I personally buy, because this kind of motif does not acknowledge the points of the other side, how sometimes in doing things for others you feel happy 1) for making another person happy and 2) for being happy that you could give happiness to others. (ex. Don’t you feel happy when you think of the perfect gift for a person you care about, and then find out that your friend loved your gift? Doing things for others is not as insufferable or oppressive or harmful as “Western” fictional mediums like to depict it to be.) I do not believe that An Na intended for this to be the usual Self triumphing over Other’s Desires thing I’m used to seeing in these Asian-American stories, if the Suna ending is anything to go by, but I thought An Na’s development of this theme was inadequate and left her conclusion missing the impact it needed. In Mina’s case, the line between doing things for others for love and doing things for others is bringing the Self suffering is crossed, and this struggle to re-negotiate these boundaries are tentatively put up into play. The problem with the depiction of this theme was that one side was too strong over the other; the mother’s desires are almost caricatures of oppressive harm, and on the other side, Mina’s love for Suna was unconvincing. They’re too didactic, and it makes this theme come across as inadequate."

If you are using a board or your own version that is using a ceramic resonator instead of a crystal, note that they are not as accurate and will introduce the possibility of higher drift levels. If you need a much higher level of timing accuracy, consider specific timer ICs such as the Maxim DS3231."

Or, you can take it during the flu for a similar effect, though it does work better at the beginning.

We were asked to interpret this however we wanted, my mind immediately went to Mermaids, Unicorns and Fairies (maybe because Crew Member 2 Loves all of the Above so that's all we hear about around here). I immediately wanted to use a stamp set of Kristal's that I hadn't gotten a chance to use yet and it fit in with the theme PERFECTLY!"

So strong that it disguised the fact that it is about 8.3% abv. (OG 1088, FG 1026). It's muddy, though. I have racked it to secondary and will keg it this weekend.

"7454","Bonded labour is prevalent in Pakistan, also known as debt bondage. Debt bondage is the repayment of debt through the provision of services e.g. labour in agriculture, brick kiln work, cotton-seed production, tanning, mining and carpet weaving industries. Again these are industries in the informal sector, which is why this system can lend itself to abuse and the system amounts to no less than slavery. Debt bondage continues to exist despite being outlawed in a number of legislations, and can end up spreading over generations so children inherit the debt and are born in to slavery."

In fact, it turns out that she is allergic to most nuts, except for walnuts and pecans.

If you are prone to giving up at the end, save yourself a little something for the end as well. Maybe it is just reviewing the work or re-formatting the paper, but there is bound to be something light that you can use to keep yourself going at the end."

If their car is something like a Focus, Astra, Scenic, Zafira then their versatility probably still suits, whilst engine efficiency and general running costs have been good enough. Who’d pay thousands even tens of thousands to change their cars for the same type of car with small improvements?"
"7469","Unexpectedly it was there, crystalclear: the existence suddenly revealed itself to me. From now on it didn't look harmless anymore. Like the safety of abstract categories. It was the stuff of which things are made, the beet of the tree was formed out of existence. The beet of the tree, the fences of the parc, the seat, the teneous grass of the lawn, all this had disappeared. The diversity of things, their own character was only an illusion, a little varnish. The varnish was gone, what was left were monstrous, weak heaps, chaotic and nude. Of a terrifying, obscene nudity."

I understood that since it was late on Friday, they would not ship until Monday. So, I was excited when I received a shipping confirmation via email on Monday. However, there was already an issue. Cheryl and Co. was shipping via UPS, which makes sense since it’s a perishable good. However, my issue was that when I was checking out, the site made me enter a USPS address. It would not allow me to enter my house address because it could not be verified by USPS as an actual address and I had to enter my PO Box to submit an order."
"7529","Tonight we had spaghetti! It's one of our go-to dishes, and I love that there are so many things you can do with spaghetti! This dish is light but full of flavor. The fire roasted tomatoes, kalamata olives, feta, and goat cheese just work so well together for a light meal. The sauce is such a nice change from the heavier marinara. The pasta water helps to thicken what is really a light juice from the tomatoes until all the other ingredients come together."

"7536","Let me write a short story on how our believe systems were formed: Suppose there are 2 dogs, one dog is home God, and another street dog. Home dog was cared, loved and accepted, given a tender and loving affection, while the street dog was kicked, stoned, beaten, chased and shout at. So, one day the two dogs were together, and a loving little boy came to play with the two dogs, the street dog ran away and the home dog welcomed him and played with the little boy. This little short story shows that our believe systems are formed from what we have experienced in life – our family, our culture, our churches – churches where ‘people can be who they are and come just the way they are’ is modeled or religious and traditionalism churches, our schools and communities formed our believe systems. Overall if we live with our parents during childhood they could be the number one how it is formed, but schools, communities and all these things had a great effects as well."

"7538","Up in a window with only a net drawn across, a woman is moving against the light like a shadow caught in a box. Her skin is smooth, her hair dark, catching the light then losing it. Dancing to no music they can hear in the street, naked as a baby. Graceful, twisting her fingers in her hair, lifting it and letting it fall back to her shoulders. She sways and turns, her skin heavy and glowing in the streetlights, then she pauses, shadows playing on"

"7545","Some of my favorite verses are below. When I first read this passage a year ago I had an understanding that we should eat the Word. Now, don’t go tearing out pages of your Bible and start eating them. I mean that we shouldn’t only read the Bible but we should eat and digest it, so that it becomes part of us. We must take note that the Bible isn’t just a book. It is a way of life."

"7548","A lady working for our television station in New York got into a taxi who brought her on a grand tour, arriving at her hotel with €65 on the meter. The cost should have been around €20 to €25 so she told the driver that she was from Dublin and that this was the route he had taken. She had written down the complete journey."
"7549","The other thing I think I will be trying is Brookfield’s idea of taking the experience of attending a professional development workshop or an academic conference as a moment to reflect on my experiences as a learner (that is, someone learning new things), and to analyse my reactions to help me identify assumptions about my own teaching and implications for my teaching practice. I’ve done something similar to this before to find out how I could become a better conference speaker, but it hadn’t occured to me to turn the experience around and look at my own learning experience. I know I will be attending a conference in July, so I shall plan ahead to view this as an opportunity to follow Brookfield’s advice and do a bit of assumption-hunting. I’ll be interested to see what surfaces, but it seems as good an opportunity as any to experiment with the process. I could also think about my identity as a singer, as I will be looking for a new teacher when I return to the UK, but that might take some time, and I think trying this on a small scale first is the way forward."

This dish would gain a valuable boost from bacon. The squash makes it, though you could substitute other veggies, specifically leafy greens, for the mushrooms – Swiss chard and spinach come to mind."
"7558","Ichabod spends his long winter evenings listening to the old wives spin yarns of ghosts and goblins and haunted fields and houses. The whole area is said to be haunted; its dominant ghost is an apparition that rides around ""on horseback without a head. It is said to be the ghost of a Hessian trooper, whose head had been carried away by a cannon-ball, in some nameless battle during the revolutionary war."" Ichabod's walks home afterwards are filled with terror, as he imagines ghosts in the shadowy shrubs and trees everywhere along his path. One autumn evening the Van Tassels host a party, attended by both Ichabod Crane and Brom Bones. It is after the party on his way home that Ichabod has his most terrifying journey ever when he encounters the headless Hessian."

"7566","The next bit, I heard from my husband, who almost threw the baby up in the air, when I instinctively made that awesome catch…. without my knowledge! When I picked up the ball, a couple of beer drinking men shouted, ‘Did she f***ing make that catch!!! That is unbelievable! Wow!’ Then, when they saw me looking around frantically for the ball, having no idea that it was in my glove, they said, ‘What is she doing?’ At this point, Sean’s jubilation at having such an athletic wife, albeit clueless was dying down a bit. He turned to the men and said, ‘She doesn’t know she has the ball!’"

Even though we don't see Tim's kids very often we love them and think about them often. In fact, Shelby's graduating from high school this next week and I'm planning on attending her graduation Saturday (if Ron feels up to it).

But at the same time I feel with the constant release of these movies I get increasingly more immune to the body cracking and the constant big bad voice coming out of creepy young girls. It just doesn't do it for me, unless we're talking strictly about the classic The Exorcist, which it's behind the scenes story is even creepier then the film itself."

I recognized some recipes from the fermentation ecourse, plus plenty of new ones. There's a huge variety, so there's bound to be something to fit everyone's taste! We love the two pickle recipes we've tried so far, and I have a delicious smelling zucchini relish ready to break into any day. We're really enjoying the ketchup and mayonnaise too.

"7589","Because most writers are a curious lot, we are comfortable learning about a variety of subjects. Most of us do this at an astonishing pace because we know how to ask subject matter experts the right questions and craft their answers into insightful, intelligent prose. If you’re looking to hire a freelance writer, and the only thing they don’t have is experience in your particular field, then ask them if they are interested in your topic. If they are, then you probably have the beginning of a beautiful working relationship. As a bonus, keep in mind the fact that if you’re paying a flat rate per article, the burden to learn about your business is on the writer."

"7593","The story takes place in the dilapidated housing projects of Essex. Yes, this is another fine British film where the degraded urban landscape matches well the grim lives of the characters who populate it. Here is where we will find Mia, who lives with her little sister and her mother Joanne (Kierston Wareling), who is of an age that suggests she was about Mia's age when giving birth to her elder daughter, and of such dubious character that she spends most of the movie boozing with and bedding men. Wareling gives a brave performance in Fish Tank, somehow managing to imbue her off-putting character with enough humanity to keep her just on the right side of monstrous. When Joanne brings home a seemingly decent chap named Conor (Michael Fassbender, who is predictably great) whose attentiveness extends beyond his sexual interest in Joanne, the movie enters an even more troubling phase. At first, Conor's kindness makes Mia wary, but eventually he wears down her reserve and distrust, leading both Conor and Mia into some challenging territory. To say more would be edging towards plot spoiler-ville, but suffice to say that as things get complicated, the film's central relationships become explosive."

This is a matter of renewed faith in imagination and a collective rebirth of humanity. The old arguments between Marxism or Leninism or Libertarianism or Anarchism didn’t go away they were just set aside while we went about the business of getting rid of the common enemy. No matter what the differences of direction to take in the future, the common enemy had to be dealt with in the present."

Sometimes I read it much differently the second day because I really understand what he’s saying as opposed to just being happy that I managed to get an email. Sometimes it reads the exact same way. If I did write a response on the same day (I don’t send them) I usually get rid of it. I write my response the day after I get the email so that it won’t hang over my head. I answer any questions that he’s asked (I love it when he asks questions because it shows that he wants to know about my life) and think of a few of my own. I share small bits of my life. And then I walk away. When I come back later, I nearly always cut half the email. I tend to write a lot, sometimes too much. So I cut the parts that don’t quite fit or the ones that no longer make sense to me. And I schedule it for a few days later (thank you Gmail for that handy feature!). Sometimes I’ll go back and reread and fix things. Sometimes I don’t because I’ve already given it a once over. It all depends on my mood and how busy I am."

"7650","Perhaps, it is time for Nolan to come to terms with the notion that he is not really meant to be a director of the big-budget action extravaganzas. As much as I like his Batman films, they meant more to me because of the characters and the moral dilemmas they raised rather than the action sequences. While I am not necessarily complaining about Nolan's directorial chops as an action filmmaker, what I feel he is lacking most is in the conception department. The very idea of ""Inception"" requires action sequences that needed a dose of the absurd rather than the functional chase and shootout stuff that dominates the movie. While the filmmaking style of ""The Matrix"" has been recycled to death, the Wachowski Brothers knew how to construct their set pieces employing the flexibility of reality in their world. Or think of the sequence in Alex Proyas' ""Dark City"" where Murdoch is chased by the Strangers while the city shape-shifts around them."

In fact, they're from (gasp!) conventionally raised chickens.

However, despite this, he was put on a medication for it - which he promptly threw up - over and over again. He was then put on another medication, which cost us not only an arm and a leg, but fingers and toes too. After no obvious improvement, he was taken off the medicine. Fast forward a few weeks, we held him down as they inserted another scope up his nose and down his throat (which he hated just as much as the first time) except at that point, his esophagus is inflammed, meaning he has silent reflux.

Every class or experience that allows for some creativity, some exploration, some ability to share new experiences with others - in other words, the things that should be the foundation of a liberal arts education - has been reduced or eliminated so that the schools can concentrate their resources on providing pedantic services in which students are often told what to think instead of experiential services in which students are allowed the freedom to explore and develop new thoughts.

Just like the old days, Karla performed with Beth and I got to witness many years after the fact, the same family magic that I'd only seen in pictures and heard about in stories around the dinner table. The rehearsal up in the Johnson's apartment was easy, casual. Our daughter Abby stood behind Karla and brushed her hair while and Avery sat with me and her Grandfather on the couch as Karla and Beth sight-read an arrangement of a song they hadn't performed together since they were in their early teens. When they performed in the chapel later that afternoon, for most people in the audience it was just a lovely little afternoon performance, but for me it was like seeing a reunion concert of the Everly Brothers, and it was as I'd been transported back to another time. There was Karla, at last, not looking like a 45 year old woman, but just like in the pictures in family albums I'd seen of her as a little girl, just a bit nervous, shifting her weight slightly from foot to foot, a little too far off mike, but blending in somehow perfectly, on pitch and in tune.

An impulse buy meant I read it on my Kindle, rather than having the pleasure of the beautiful paper edition, hard backed with a silvery design like the book of Russian folk tales featured in the story. My loss, I think. An aging childless couple, battling the elements to settle in Alaska, build a child out of snow. The snow child becomes a beautiful girl, but is she real? I certainly wanted to believe. Whereas The Shipping News gave us the bitter cold of small town Newfoundland, The Snow Child evokes the rhythm of the seasons and the natural world. A lovely book."

(Don't remember, we've had it all for a while, and they were gifts.) Really inexpensive stuff, though. And I also painted all the blocks in the green canvas bin on top of the toy box, then just used alphabet stickers I had in my scrapbook stuff. The magnet boards and toys.Now I'll tell you about the details, and all the good deals I found. The magnet board is an oil change pan. I got the idea from pinterest. The pinner said, $12.99 at Wal-mart, but I got mine for less than $10.00 at Auto Zone. That, and this road-rug were the only two things I bought for the room. Everything else was stuff I already had.The framed striped magnet boards were just unfinished ones I've had forever. I painted them white, then put blue painters tape on them to do the stripes. I love how they turned out. Garrett loves magnets. He's obsessed with these boards. All the magnets are from Micheal's and Hobby Lobby, between 10 and 50 cents each. The pop cycle stick ones I painted myself and just glued a magnet on the back of each one."

"7749","The large media companies have also diversified beyond the media field, and non-media companies have established a strong presence in the mass media. The most important cases of the latter are GE, owning RCA, which owns the NBC network, and Westinghouse, which owns major television-broadcasting stations, a cable network, and a radio station network. GE and Westinghouse are both huge, diversified multinational companies heavily involved in the controversial areas of weapons production and nuclear power. It may be recalled that from I965 to I967, an attempt by International Telephone and Telegraph (ITT) to acquire ABC was frustrated following a huge outcry that focused on the dangers of allowing a great multinational corporation with extensive foreign investments and business activities to control a major media outlet. The fear was that ITT control “could compromise the independence of ABC’s news coverage of political events in countries where ITT has interests.” The soundness of the decision disallowing the acquisition seemed to have been vindicated by the later revelations of ITT’s political bribery and involvement in attempts to overthrow the government of Chile. RCA and Westinghouse, however, had been permitted to control media companies long before the ITT case, although some of the objections applicable to ITT would seem to apply to them as well. GE is a more powerful company than ITT, with an extensive international reach, deeply involved in the nuclear power business, and far more important than ITT in the arms industry. It is a highly centralized and quite secretive organization, but one with a vast stake in “political” decisions. GE has contributed to the funding of the American Enterprise Institute, a right-wing think tank that supports intellectuals who will get the business message across. With the acquisition of ABC, GE should be in a far better position to assure that sound views are given proper attention. The lack of outcry over its takeover of RCA and NBC resulted in part from the fact that RCA control over NBC had already breached the gate of separateness, but it also reflected the more pro-business and laissez-faire environment of the Reagan era."

Finding the note as lovely as the ghost who blew it out of the bronze horn centuries ago, the editor has no choice but to include it in the dictionary. Several decades later, Mithra sees “dord” in the dictionary (Mithra does, indeed, read every book which comes into print, but does not read them at the speed of light.) and finally reincarnates Davy as a TV star and musician (Again, as a newborn baby first.) Davy at last experiences the wonders of technology he future-glimpsed long ago, and the teen idol fame he sought since before Bronze Age. Then he dies, this time from a heart attack. But the DORD echoes on."

"7804","In the end, there may be a universal truth, but in the mean time, we’re speaking for whatever divine power is defining those truths and writing these commandments and codes of social morality. St. Paul may tolerate the atrocities of his time or he may have excused them or even found them morally justified; the society he lived in found justification despite (or, if you take the whole book they found their morality in, because of) that code of morality. The ancient Jews found their justification in divine truth – as did the Babylonians, Sumerians, Romans, and every believer of non-secular morality. To suggest secular moralists need to find a higher source of universal truth in morality is placing a challenge that non-secularists are unwilling to, or incapable, of taking on – because, in the end, non-secular morality is secular morality with a halo slapped on it."

For a show that sets up a “sisters at odds” premise in its first episode to not have them come face-to-face in the ensuing season is nothing but narrative wheel-spinning, and has left all the actors involved with the unenviable task of explaining away their constant heel face turns depending on the necessities of that week’s craziness. Andrew Martin goes from doting husband to possible killer depending on Bridget’s suspicions, his daughter is either an innocent product of a broken home or a manipulative rape-crying mastermind, and Siobhan’s lover Henry starts off as a bravado junkie in a turtle neck before descending into a murderous arch villian (in a turtle neck).

It was so lovely to walk through and see the wood shingled trucks, and the farmers proudly talking about their product. We were staying in a hotel, so buying lots of produce wasn't really an option - but we did eat a whoopie pie or two, and gobbled down a few bins of blackberries and blueberries as we walked the market."

It is an illusion that youth is happy, an illusion of those who have lost it; but the young know they are wretched, for they are full of the truthless ideals which have been instilled into them, and each time they come in contact with the real they are bruised and wounded. It looks as if they were victims of a conspiracy; for the books they read, ideal by the necessity of selection, and the conversation of their elders, who look back upon the past through a rosy haze of forgetfulness, prepare them for an unreal life. They must discover for themselves that all they have read and all they have been told are lies, lies, lies; and each discovery is another nail driven into the body on the cross of life.

"7919","This poster by McKnight Kauffer (1924) was commissioned to encourage the use of the London transport system. In the 1920′s and 30′s consumer and household buying power had begun to slowly shift to the women of the house, and increasingly advertising campaigns were directed at women. The London Underground in fact commissioned a whole series on various reasons as to why the Underground was beneficial for women to use. Strong deco and extremely modern elements in this poster are the rampant use of circle and lines, and blocks of colour with very little gradient, coupled with constant repetition. The idea that the poster portrays is the harried and difficult nature of travelling ‘above ground’ during the depths of a dark and windy winter. The poster borders on abstract, and uses text shaped to emphasize the messy predicament that the dark figure (notably a woman) finds herself in, with nothing but an umbrella to shelter from driving rain."

"7941","Some hold that it should be possible to legally challenge political manifestos, yet where this has been attempted courts have held that an elected member ‘ought’ to give considerable weight, when deciding whether to implement policies put forward in a pre-election manifesto. However elected representatives must not treat themselves as irrevocably bound to carry out pre-announced policies contained in election manifestos. Moreover The Court of Appeal held that to hold that the pre-election promises bound a newly elected Government could well be inimical to good government. It was one thing to say that an administration properly and morally ought to have regard to its pre-election promises. It was another to say that it must have regard to them and a yet further thing to say that it must ordinarily act on them. The law went nowhere near that. The Court of Appeal emphasised that it did not wish any encouragement to politicians to be extravagant in their pre-election promises, but when a party elected into office fails to keep its election promises, the consequences should be political and not legal. (source) So we see that pre-election promises are not legally enforceable, which begs the question why do politicians make pre-election promises that they cannot keep? This may be because it is easy to promise dramatic changes to the law when not in Government, but more difficult to make them work in practice. Also, when elected, the party may have more information available to them and realise that the pre-election promises are not very practical. On that last point I would contend that if the required research had been carried out properly then politicians would be aware of the point about practicality. This is especially so where this country's membership of the European Union is concerned and when politicians promise action in an area that is a competence of the EU."

"7971","Allonsanfàn is a wry, strange look at the absurd tragedy of radical Italians. It technically takes place in the early 19th century, but it could be just as home in the 1860s, 1920s or 1970s. In fact, especially the 1970s - a decade in which domestic terrorism killed Aldo Moro and laid bombs in Bologna's train station. A decade where the idealism of 1968 had ripened into a hyper-violent, extreme nihilism (both on the Left and the Right), where killing became a currency of discourse. (Thanks, Paul Ginsborg, by the way, for teaching the PPCC about modern Italian history! Seriously, readership, A History of Contemporary Italy is wonderful.)"

My other 3 Henry paintings...ready for a bonfire come winter...include his full body. Something about that wild hair-do with the sleek body did not make a lovely painting, too much of a textural weird contrast or at least that's how I've justified those 3 bonfire failures. My husband (thanks, honey) has assured me ""not all dogs are supposed to be painted and this one is just ugly""."

Headphones on and we were off, shooting across farmland, forest and foothills. There was affair amount of turbulence, but hat just added to the fun. Aaron was grinning like an idiot as we ascended through a patch of low cloud and the glacier came into full view below us. The moraines and seracs looked tiny, but I knew that the small ones were as big as double decker buses and the biggest must have been the size of 20 storey buildings. The crevices went from white to royal blue to black, thousands of deadly traps moving like a slow sea down the mountain. It was difficult to imagine that this massive, multi-million ton slab of ice was more liquid than solid, carving it’s own valley as it went. I would have liked to have seen it at its peak, before it had started to recede back up the mountain, when it had been at its most magnificent and filled the valley it had cut. The glacier was still moving at anywhere between 1 to 7 metres every day, sadly melting at the same time as crawling forward with its immense weight, a shadow of its formal self. The glacier runs from top to bottom for 7.5km to a height of 300m above sea level. What makes it remarkable and very alluring is that it is also flanked by temperate rainforest. The contrast is striking, only in South America can you find similar environments."
"7982","We find this kind of life in relationship with the God who gives. That’s what our understanding of grace is all about – our God gives. He’s not a god who sits far off in heaven & expects us to give & give & make sacrifice after sacrifice to try to make him happy. Our God is happy with us for Christ’s sake & so is happy to give us what we need. He gives rain to the unrighteous & righteous alike (check out Matthew 5:44-45 for example) and so his giving is unconditional & indiscriminate. The clearest place we see the heart of this giving God is in giving his Son to die for us, and Jesus himself is willing to give himself for us on the cross. This goes beyond a trite & cliché religious formula – it’s the greatest expression of sacrificial giving ever! If God is willing to give us his own Son, and if the Son is willing to give all of himself to us in his death, and if the Father is willing & able to give his dead Son new life in the resurrection, how much more will he be willing to give us what we need for every aspect of life, both in this world & in the next?"

"7985","Conservatives were much more likely than liberals to believe in life after death, with approximately 80% of conservatives/extreme conservatives reporting that they believe in life after death and only 66% of liberals/extremely liberals reporting the same. (All percentages are rounded upwards.) While a person's belief in life after death is not necessarily predictive of whether he fears death, the results are suggestive and weaken Pyszczynski's paradigm. The Pyszczynski et al theories would seem to imply that belief in life after death is a cognitive defensive mechanism but a sizable proportion of individuals with liberal orientations clearly exhibit the same phenomenon, so it is as least not a peculiarly conservative defence mechanism. And in any event, the number of people who absolutely reject the possibility of an afterlife is very small, only about 9% in this database."

Well done to Paul for challenging him and giving him the Church's view of what is really, to put it mildly, a very reckless and really terrible thing to be doing. Essentially, as anyone who has heard of Nitzchke will know, he prepares the ground for people to commit suicide, selling 'suicide kits' to the vulnerable and basically showing people how it is done. May God protect Eastbourne's elderly, sick and vulnerable from the terrible beliefs of Dr Philip Nitzchke. I know we are living in an age in which moral relativism is endemic, but even though we have the obvious 'evil dressed up as good' situation here, it is difficult to make sense of what Nitzchke is doing. What was unthinkable years ago is very much on the table now."
"7990","The darkness brightens up and on stage bound The Sex Pistols. It is January 14th 1978, Winterland Garden, San Francisco. The Sex Pistols, on their first major US tour, play their set. Songs like God Save the Queen, Anarchy in the USA, Bodies, Holidays in the Sun and Pretty Vacant are blasted out. Contempt is in the eyes of Johnny Rotten, Sid Vicious is totally wasted and later revealed his bass wasn't plugged in. The band play a tight a restrictive set which lasts just over 45 minutes. The encore is the son No Fun, which from the look of the band was how they thought of the concert. The song finishes and Johnny ends with the lingering words ""Ever get the feeling you've been cheated...Ha Ha"". The rest is history. The following morning the band more or less officially split, and for punk the same was true. When the Sex Pistols died, punk was not far behind. Buy this cassette as it is a priceless record of the only true punk band, all be it in their death throws. Videos such as this one and the film The Great Rock 'N' Roll Swindle should keep die hard fans satisfied until The Filth and the Fury is released."

I described my story, which is a (hopefully) comic fable, “A Short History of Synchronised Breathing”. Then I described my own journey as a woman writer - being advised early on to write under a pseudonym if I wanted to be taken seriously by the literary establishment. Deciding not to, as that was dishonest. I'd take my chances.

I just feel that I must have missed the facts of some past things or perhaps some facts were intentionally hidden from me. I’ll use all the learning to make a better future. Even just looking at the facts I do know, I’m doing the best thing now I guess. I believe my feet are now on a well-constructed path where landslides and potholes can be avoided (mostly.) One thing I’ve learned is that to build something well, you have to be prepared to possibly invest years of work. It’s a lot! People have baggage and it’s quite a process fitting into the same taxi to begin a new journey of life together. Some will never get to the point of being able to put some of that in the trunk and forget it! Some just stay in the same cyclic routine for many years. Ironically and maybe only personal coincidence, but I’ve discovered that those same people are the ones to preach about how to have a good relationship."

Ultimately, there will be fewer companies in the insurance space. We are seeing a shrinkage and consolidation that is only going to accelerate.

Many of the other large media firms have boards made up predominantly of insiders, a general characteristic of relatively small and owner-dominated companies. The larger the firm and the more widely distributed the stock, the larger the number and proportion of outside directors. The composition of the outside directors of the media giants is very similar to that of large non-media corporations. … active corporate executives and bankers together account for a little over half the total of the outside directors of ten media giants; and the lawyers and corporate-banker retirees (who account for nine of the thirteen under “Retired”) push the corporate total to about two-thirds of the outside-director aggregate.

Edge ---- ware-road!' shout the guards, emphasizing the last syllable after the manner of railway tradition. The carriage doors are flung open, and I have no sooner popped in and seated myself than they are shut again, and the train is in motion. One last gleam of daylight enters at the window, and then we plunge into the tunnel. Not into darkness, though - there is a good steady light from the gas-burner above, which enables you to read, should you be so inclined, as easily as you could by your moderator lamp at home; or you may lean back in the well-cushioned, comfortable seat of the most roomy railway carriage in England, and, forgetting that you have twenty feet of earth above you, contemplate your opposite neighbours. Mine was a timid, pretty girl of sixteen, taking her first subterranean ride in London, under her father's care. I saw the little delicate and ungloved hand creep gradually towards his whenever the signal-whistle was louder than usual, or when the train swayed slightly to and fro at its highest speed. Papa was absorbed in the 'Times,' and I don't think paid that attention to his pretty daughter which - well, which somebody else might have bestowed in his place. Ah, fair unknown - sweet stranger, in the seal-skin jacket, mauve-ribboned bonnet, and infinitesimal boots! - who shut the carriage-window when you complained of a draught? and who opened it again the instant you hinted at a headache? Who picked up that delicate little mouchoir of yours from the carpet? Who jumped out before the train stopped (in direct opposition to the advice of the Company), in order to assist you in alighting? You will read HIS initials at the conclusion of this article; and if, perchance, you should regret that, during your transit from Paddington to Newgate, you (very properly) did not reward his attentions with a single glance, remember that the slightest acknowledgment, conveyed (with papa's permission) to C. L. E., through the Editor of 'London Society,' will be still received with the deepest gratitude."

Most of these queries were answered in the book, but I had a few special, personally concocted questions thrown in there. I spent my nights in those hotel rooms reading and amassing my plans for when we got to sit down with Levon. It was incredibly exciting...the closer and closer we got to Woodstock, the more my adrenals were pumping away. I had met many celebrities before, but I had never been to one's house to interview them, so I was pretty keyed up. I didn't know Levon at that point, so I didn't know that all I needed to be was myself. Steve, meanwhile, wearing his multi-colored beret and holding a half-smoked cigar in hand, was cool as could be. It was difficult for me to read his emotions, which I guess was a feature that made him a bit more of a professional than me."

My life is dedicated to Jesus the Christ the living Son the first born of many as Paul says the first the choices fruit, of the living G-d. so the second and the first have much the same meaning for me; this means: respect of others as much as for your-self . We are here to serve each other- not as slaves, but as family to nurture, care for ,to see that each attains their highest potential. The choices we make determine the life we lead; so the life you have chosen for your self, is bound by those choices. It is said a person can not change, however one can choose to change at any time. This I promise, I may not agree with you ,nor you with me, but you have the right to live as you choose as do I. And I will fight for you to do just that , I will expect the same from you.

The Pavilion will take visitors beneath the Serpentine’s lawn to explore the hidden history of its previous Pavilions. Eleven columns characterising each past Pavilion and a twelfth column will support a floating platform roof 1.5 metres above ground. Taking an archaeological approach, the architects have created a design that will inspire visitors to look beneath the surface of the park as well as back in time across the ghosts of the earlier structures.

"8204","The nature of beer in the UK is changing, stronger beers are becoming more popular in that brewers are brewing more of them, consumers are drinking more of them so it seems wise to facilitate more ways of serving them. There are voices who see this as step towards making Britain more continental in style, cafe-bars, restaurants & craft beer houses serving smaller measures of artisan higher abv. beers that are better enjoyed in smaller quantities. I certainly see this as an opportunity to bring beer closer to the food industry giving scope to match beer in a more appropriate measure with food is an avenue that should be explored."

Suicide as a murder weapon and homosexual incest are some of the psychological tragedies whose consequences are unravelled by the mind of Holmes before the eyes of Watson."" The last book of short stories, and somewhat inferior to the best of the series, I think. But it is a long while since I read any others, and maybe they are all of this kind but have gained substance in my memory. I didn't notice any story containing homosexual incest either, but I'm not going back to find it. The book is also an 'Oxford World's Classics' edition complete with asterisks in the text leading to endnotes giving explanations and definitions which are annoyingly unnecessary for this reader - the meaning of the words 'cravat' and 'spats' could be found in any half-decent dictionary."

The potty lines - non-existent - walked right in! Then I was off to meet up with the infamous Boring Runner (I quickly deemed him NOT boring at all)!

Even back in the 19th century, anarchists argued that this was a pipe dream.

As NinetyDays2Life began to evolve, I started to realize that the issue was metaphysical, that the dis-ease inhabited the mind and manifested in the body, and I can tell you that there were so many mixed reviews on much of what I presented in the end. I found that nutrition was more of an art, and that indulgence didn’t signify living a good life. Realistically, our indulgences and wants are what destroy us.

In God’s order, we judge those who would claim to be Christian according to God’s standards of behavior and we judge the remaining world by a lesser standard, knowing that they do not know Christ. As Paul writes, “I have written you in my letter not to associate with sexually immoral people – not at all meaning the people of this world who are immoral, or the greedy and swindlers, or idolaters. In that case you would have to leave the world. But now I am writing you that you must not associate with anyone who calls himself a brother, but is sexually immoral or greedy, an idolater or a slanderer, a drunkard or a swindler.” 1 Cor. 5:9-11 In man’s order, we tell each other that we must not judge; in God’s order we “must” judge those who claim to be part of the family. The order of God and the order of man are even different when it comes to how judging should occur. While it is fine to seek the law courts to obtain judgment involving non-Christians, the order of God is that, among those within the church, disputes should be handled within the church. “If any of you has a dispute with another, dare he take it before the ungodly for judgment instead of before the saints?” 1 Cor. 6:1"

That there ensues some degree of partisan prejudice was almost to be expected, as the wider public may still hold various oppositional perspectives based on an until recently dominant Christian cultural ideology and its ensuing misinformation against Paganism and Witchcraft in particular. That such views should apparently inform an objective academic in his choice of how to handle his subject matter is not a question that I am well enough equipped to consider.

"8314","that I first heard the names of Reinhold Niebuhr and Paul Tillich from President Carter. It was in the course of his 1976 Presidential campaign. I was 16 years old, and I had never heard those names before. I went to look them up. Now, at age 16 I did not find out a great deal about those two men, but as I studied theology as an academic discipline, I certainly did. It’s interesting of course that he would site those two theologians as most formative, in terms of his life and his thinking. Reinhold Niebuhr was a very complex figure, a titanic figure of Protestant theology of the twentieth century. A man who did indeed stress the reality of human sinfulness, but he did so primarily in terms of social structures. Not in terms of individual responsibility. There is a great question as to whether Reinhold Niebuhr actually believed in a personal God even though he did believe in a force of divine justice. Now when we come to Paul Tillich, there is an altogether different picture. We are rather certain that he did not believe in a personal God. In fact, he made very clear that he did not. He did not believe in a personal God, a revealing God, a God who speaks in scripture, but rather he believed in a great force, a ground of being. He merged existentialism with theological language. In other words, Paul Tillich was one of the most radical theologians of the twentieth century, and of course he gave birth to other radical schools of theology that followed. Now, the interesting thing to note here is that if you were a young man, a thinking young man, a thinking young protestant in the twentieth century during the decades when Jimmy Carter was coming to his intellectual maturity, if you were certain that vast social change needed to take place, you often looked to those leaders who were riveting the intellectual super structure for those changes. Unfortunately, on the theological side, it was often the liberal theologians who were right on some of the most important social issues. And altogether, too many young evangelicals attached their theological allegiance to liberal theologians who were right on other issues but deeply wrong on areas of theology. This lead to a trajectory where as there were a good many people who were raised in the piety of the Southern Baptist Convention and other denominations in the United States, but whose minds became very much attached to and even dependent upon theologians whose own theological systems were radically at odds with those who they had known as children. One of the things that we need to note is that theology matters. Isn’t it interesting that this theme that theology matters comes up in a conversation with the man whose chief claim to fame, notoriety and historical significance, is that he served not as a theologian and chief, but as Commander in Chief,"

"8334","I was given a beautiful gift today by a special Lady and Friend, Sandi! Now as I write this I want Sandi to know that I always thought of her as a special and sweet woman and friend. I went to our modern quilt group today. I wasn't feeling wonderful but wanted to be around familiar faces and friends. Lately I seem to be able to start allot but not finish anything, I don't know if it is the nature of the beast that is inside me right now or what? I was told by another friend not to worry she felt the same way. Anyway Sandi, Linda and I get together once a month to share our valuable time and laughter and it is truly a wonderful time by all. Sandi is a very involved member of our modern quilt guild and it was nice to see her and many other members today. Well she was showing this beautiful quilt made with blocks that I saw hanging in her studio awhile back and made a comment back then on how much I loved the blocks. Then she bought it closer to me and tossed it to me saying well this is for you....stunned would be a good word to put in here now cause that is how I felt. Let me explain.... When I was first diagnosed oh my gosh the tears flowed like a creek all day and night then I got up the next day and said ok the only way to do this is head on and no pity or tears. I told myself to get my big girl pants on and fight and basically that is what I have done. I feel if I shed tears I will become weak and that will not work with the work that I had in front of me, fighting something I knew nothing about. So I do my best whether they be sad, fearful, happy or worried tears, I do my best not to shed them. But Sandi did make me push myself today when she gave me this beautiful quilt. I got a little teary but it took all I had but believe me they were tears of joy. It is one of the most precious gifts that I have been given by a friend. Sandi I will treasure it always and ""thank you "" just does not seem to be enough. Having you as a friend has truly been a blessing and a gift."

Because it’s “cool” won’t last a week. “Dig deep” is what they say when a guy is sucking on a foot march or a run. If you do this right, there should be a whole lot of mental tumbling going on when a person decides this is what they want to do as a profession. This is a serious business, and it deserves serious thought. Being burned out will happen from time to time. The physical exhaustion of military service, the stress of leadership and the mission, and balancing these with social and familiar obligations will eventually pile up to a point that overwhelms a person. If we’ve done the mental gymnastics that answer the question “why” beforehand though, then “digging deep” will never be necessary – the answer will always be right there."

The time could be best described using two adjectives, “expressive” and “jubilant”. I was taken back to books I’ve read on revivals of centuries past. One of the common-denominators in God-sent revivals is the way in which a congregation steps into a united pursuit of Jesus, regardless of whether they are being led by a worship leader or pastor. The Spirit of God begins leading others to sing out songs, seemingly random passion-filled praying, shouts of rejoicing, etc. I witnessed this happening. Goose bumps. What a work God is doing all around the world. And here I am, in just one small congregation in the midst of a massive city, watching Jesus smile upon His children and their hungering after Him. Do you ever get the feeling like God is setting you up for something grand? Something that you may every now and again get a small taste of? In reality, He’s setting us all up for eternal Heaven, but He’s also setting us up for Heaven flowing through the hands and feet of God-fearing saints right here, right now. Press in! Don’t give up. Our time is too short to lose track of what God wants to accomplish. I have many dreams that have remained unfulfilled, mainly a massive outpouring of the Holy Spirit on this generation that is undeniable even to the secular world perspective. But, here I am New York City, experiencing a trickling waterfall of God’s grace. Jesus makes all things New! New York City made New – That’s one thing Jesus showed me. When the Gospel takes center stage, entire cities are turned into bubbling expressions of the river of life. That is Biblical revival."

If there’s one thing I can tell you though, is that it’s the mother of all horror genre films. However, it’s not exactly frightening. “Cabin in the Woods” is a tough film to peg because it’s the ultimate representation of multiple genres, including comedy, horror, slasher, and monster flicks. It takes what you’re all too familiar with and deconstructs it to the point where you have to wonder what’s left over for other filmmakers."

Shelley' to the almost unbearably poignant last letters of a man still in the thick of things and full of literary plans. The letters describing his travels in Italy are superb, as are the ones charting the always difficult relationship with Byron. When writing about his own work he is modest, fateful, almost sad.

However, the closer Alice had got to the forest, the fouler the weather became. The sun had almost completely retreated and now its foul cousins the wind and rain had come.

Interestingly Gladstone is reported as wearing the colour blue when fighting the seat, often seen as a colour for the Liberals in those days (Conservatives often used the colour red at the time). He won the seat and held it until 1880, defending it successfully in the 1874 general election, after which Gladstone went north to represent Midlothian. It was quite usual in the 19th century for politicians to hop about from one constituency to another or indeed to fight two seats at once."

The beer is rooted in a trip I took to Alsace in 2003. The local bars all seemed to have Lindemans Gueuze (which I consumed in copious amounts) and Adelscott, a peat-smoked amber lager. It wasn't the craftiest brew I've had but I liked the idea. The scotch enthusiast in me decided right then and there to reproduce that flavor profile down the road. After brewing our oyster stout recently I felt that the time was finally right. We harvested some of the Scottish ale yeast from that batch and set about making the Auld Reekie. Instead of our usual organic pale malt we used Weyermann Bohemian pilsener malt along with both domestic and English caramel malts and of course the peat-smoked malt as well. We pitched lots of yeast and fermented around 62F for a smooth and clean profile which seems to have worked well. I can't wait to try it with some scotch on the side! We'll tap more of it here when the Gose keg blows and expect to see it around town in the coming weeks."

Don't be fooled by the likes of Breivik. Just like 9/11, 7/7, Pearl Harbour, the Madrid and Bali bombings, the Israeli attack on the USS Liberty, both World Wars, and many many other acts of pure evil, the Oslo atrocity was the work of the Elders of Zion.

We also read about a Turkish immigrant guy who spotted a piece of wasteland near his home, and decided to grow some vegetables there. Turns out that piece of land officially belonged to East Berlin, but had ended up on the western side of the Wall. Something to do with building the Wall in a straight line and not wasting ressources by building around that little plot. Anyway, the East German border guards weren’t too pleased with Mr Kalin (that was his name) digging up their land but eventually, after a lot of toing and froing they let him get on with it, as he was a poor immigrant suffering under the Capitalist system and having to grow his own food.

I finished off the main image with some of Martha's butterfly punches to create the butterflies out of vellum."

I’ve accumulated a veritable mountain of sheet masks from my travels, mostly from Taiwan, Hong Kong and now Korea. The sheer variety of sheet masks available in Korea is mind-boggling, and they’re very affordable. In most stores, they come in packs of 10s as many people tend to buy in bulk. I saw a lady grabbing at least 10 packs of 10 sheets at Skinfood!! I wish i had the luggage space to do that, buy I had to control myself =P"

Simply asking for his inheritance was the equivalent of saying he wished his father were dead.

The Three Angry Lawyers have had their fill of slimy lawyers using social media to promote their law practices unethically, they have had enough of snake oil, carpet bagging and SEO and other social media mavens. I agree with much of what they say. They have even got stuck into a new phenomenon… ‘GHOST BLOGGERS’. It appears that some lawyers in the States are too dumb to even write their own blogs. It isn’t exactly rocket science to write a blog… but some of these enterprising souls are hiring ‘writers’ to write their blogs for them – ludicrous. The interview is worth watching – although the film took a bit of time to load last night when I watched it."

Their previous two albums were both great in places, but always left me with a finger on the 'forward' button, wishing for a little more. This time though they have made a great album from start to finish (OK, OK, maybe 'Wrestlers' is a weak link!). For me a great album is STILL so simple... well structured great tunes, catchy hooks and intelligent lyrics. If that's your recipe too, then this could be an album for you! Stand out track for me is Hold On - a really great, intelligent dance track, a thumpin full on disco bass laced with scratchy guitar sounds and the funkiest of rhythms."

"8636","There weren't too many let-downs this year for me. But I have to say my first novel taste of Alastair Reynolds, Terminal World, certainly soured me on him a bit yet I still intend to read some of his older work. Paul Hoffman's much touted The Left Hand of God started off so strongly and than degenerated into something not all that special. George Mann's Ghosts of Manhattan could have also been better in a lot of ways despite enjoying it for what pulpy fun it was. I was also mildly disappointed in Antiphon since I loved Ken Scholes's first two Psalms of Isaak books Lamentation and Canticle, so very much and have been talking them up to friends nearly non-stop. This is not to say that Antiphon is a poor read. It still kept me interested in the narrative, but I just didn't like the way a couple formerly main characters were given such back seat roles for much of the story. You can still count on me being there for Requiem next year as soon as it is out. But for every disappointment there have been a dozen books I adored. So all in all I called this a great year for genre publishing with many new stars debuting. 2011 is looking very bright as well with these new voices and many of the masters all re-entering into the fray."

Unfortunately though, it seems to be another prime source of information and comments best left ignored. The anonymity of the internet allows people to feel entitled to say things to and about us that they would never have the courage, and many times even the inclination, to say to our faces. For example, early on in my blog, I wrote a post which contained some of my feelings about the experience of adopting my daughter. Someone commented that they had featured my blog post on their blog and to click over and check it out. When I did, I discovered that this person had used my words, which I had thought were filled with love, as evidence that adoption was bad. Several of her readers commented that I should never have been given a child in adoption, and that I was not a fit parent. My first response was to get upset and defensive and leave a comment of my own--but I soon realized it wouldn't do any good. After all, these folks had never met me, and really didn't have any valid information with which to judge my suitability for parenthood. Any comment that I wrote would be unlikely to change their minds, and an internet fight was not going to be good for my emotional health. So I decided to leave the situation alone, and it quickly blew over, without any effort on my part."

Well, the “Al Pack” contained a sleeveless t-shirt (oxymoron alert), beef jerky, peanut M&Ms, the movie Hanna, and a 12-pack of Bud Light Platinum. After he rummaged through it, he thanked us. I said, “I hope you like it, you’re so hard to shop for.” “Yeah, he said, I just come home, pop open a beer, then water the grass.” He’s a simple guy.

He can recite them on cue, if needed. To him, this is a huge birthday, because what birthday’s aren’t? And I guess by throwing him a party he thinks we revel in the passing of another year the same way he does.

"8761","There are also many cases of extreme loss or intense turmoil, when all of the ego’s building blocks – its roles and attachments – are broken away. A person might be diagnosed with cancer and told they only have a few months left to live; an alcoholic might reach ‘rock bottom’ and be on the point of suicide; a person might become seriously disabled through injury or illness; or they might suffer from the trauma of bereavement, depression, the destruction of hopes and beliefs, and so on. In most cases, these forms of loss simply bring sadness and suffering, but for a minority of individuals, they can trigger a spiritual awakening. With all its scaffolding broken down, the normal ego-self dissolves away, and our deeper, truer self emerges in its place, like a butterfly from a caterpillar. The person feels re-born, like a different person inhabiting the same body, with a new sense of meaning and connection."
"8762","With this in mind, we cannot rely on our government to appropriate all elements of divine justice. Though there are elements of the moral law which governments deem necessary to defend, there are many others which they do not and should not. For instance, is it appropriate for lust to be punishable by civil authorities and if so, is it even possible? Practicality comes into play here, but also the idea that government is not God’s direct form of the punishment of sin. God’s direct punishment for our sin is revealed in his plan for the afterlife. Sin itself is not correctable on the civil level. Punishment is not correction. Punishment is not a cure. Punishment is at its core, a declaration of wrongdoing. It may reveal that as humans, we are indeed not right inside; that we do bad and we need a public recognition of such to prove it to ourselves again and again. But punishment for wrongdoing doesn’t make right. As we see during examples of capital punishment, the murderer who is killed by the state for crimes committed against his fellow man does not have his crimes undone in the moment he takes his final breath. Family members of the criminal’s victim do not experience the resurrection of their lost loved ones. Yet, often they find comfort in the fact that evil doesn’t have free reign over society, that some semblance of right and wrong is recognized by human institutions. A right doesn’t erase a wrong. But it does offer us hope that we don’t have to be controlled by wrong. It speaks to order of the universe, that right is the guide through the chaos. Governments punish to retain order, not to correct our sinful tendencies."

Not only are you still in short strolling distance of campus and Tesco, Hythe is in much greater proximity to town, leaving a journey that is within walking distance.

"8812","Perhaps representative of the Gnostic branch of bishops in the English-speaking world was one Richard Duc de Palatine, an Australian originally named Ronald Powell, who was initially ordained in the Liberal Catholic Church and, in 1953, consecrated a bishop by Mar Georgius I (Hugh George de Willmott Newman), Patriarch of Glastonbury, one of the most fecund independent bishops. Palatine then founded his own Pre-Nicene Gnostic Catholic Church. Palatine, whose penchant for organising esoteric orders was second to none, also founded the Order of the Pleroma, the Brotherhood of the Pleroma, the Disciplina Arcani, and the Hermetic Brotherhood of Light. These appear to have led a largely mail-order existence.7 Palatine’s episcopal concerns were intermingled with esoteric, magical, and even Freemasonic preoccupations, but in spite of this – or perhaps due to it – some serious modern Gnostics became associated with him. The most notable is Bishop Stephan Hoeller, arguably the foremost proponent of a contemporary Gnosticism."

I remember flipping through a House Beautiful and running across a piece on her...and thinking Tricia Guild what a cool name, and then reading further and finding out that the surname Guild was the Guild in Designer's Guild...talk about a light bulb moment! Here is a little snippet viaWikipedia click here to read more."
"8831","Joyce is setting Gabriel up to be humbled, to step outside of himself. Even from the start Gabriel's central position in the story is always being threatened. Other guests come and go, and he's buffeted by them, pushed off the page by their colorful personalities. He makes some egotistical blunders that bely his image as an attentive sophisticated man, and he wavers with self-doubt. At one point he's dancing with another guest, Miss Ivors, who comments on his lack of connection with Ireland. When he loses his composure and tells her that he's sick of his own country, she asks him ""Why?"" and he can't answer. By the end there's something of an answer; Gabriel's distaste stems in part from his discomfort with himself and his unwillingness to confront what's lacking in his life and experiences. He's too softly civilized to accommodate his own country and its people, its passions and history."

"8834","Notice that the word noted here in v.9 is a different word. Here the word to remember is not anamnesis but anamninesko. A different word is used, and it is not related to sacrifice, but only recalling. Here is where the focus is on God recalling his people. However, when we get to v. 10, the word used here for an offering is a sacrificial offering. The word that is translated as a sacrificial offering is anamnesis, here the English translation as remembrance. This again, happens to be the same Greek word that Paul uses in 1 Cor. 11:24 and 25, and Luke uses in Luke 22:19, in the institution of the Eucharist. It is not merely about remembering something."
"8835","There was a trial run of the competition on Tuesday with Bexhill High school students. The students, aged 12, were asked to build a cardboard chair that would hold the weight of a Brighton University final year product design student, Sam.

A lovely, fun day was had by all!"

"8840","But I’m most proud when I can apply this all to cooking. I like shopping for food sales, and I like seeing what I can make that doesn’t cost much. Take, for example, the thing that has become my new favourite quick meal: rice with broth poured over it for flavour. A cup of rice in the rice cooker, some leftover broth from soup or stew or whatever I’ve made recently that has broth or juices that I’ve collected, and voila! A simple tasty meal that costs maybe $0.50 for all the ingredients I used. It’s not very varied, and it’s not a well-balanced meal, but it’s quick, simple, and delicious. And when you’re in a financial bind, half a dollar for a meal isn’t a price to sneeze at!"

First time writer/director, Warwick Thornton follows the film's two protagonists, a pair of Aboriginal kids living in a run-down community in Central Australia.

Since that time I have been slowly trying process what transpired. 14 or so individuals (not counting Grant and myself) sitting around two big library tables pulled together was a little intimidating. And when it came to discussions about data and percentages of pull-out versus push-in and weekly minutes in the triple digits….well, my brain shut that part out for fear of vertigo and vomiting. (Some day I hope to write more about my newly self-diagnosed dyscalculia~it has a name!) Anyway, if you asked me now, I would not be able to tell you exactly what even came out of that IEP…that’s how badly I block data and numbers.

But many within these sectors have also engaged in protest actions of different sorts, in order to reshape campus life and to call for a more egalitarian university. Recent protest actions have offered alternative models of how we might maintain and defend the educational project of the university – models that run counter to those preferred by campus administrators, but that nevertheless operate according to some of the same principles, or with some of the same stated aims."

She is a woman who is balancing the personal and professional in admirable ways. She is an outstanding woman who will be an excellent role model for the nation’s young people. Sarah Palin is chief among equals with American professional women; she brings the kind of balance that characterizes the high-achieving women of today.

The fast is the long, woozy summer which numbs us every year.

Also interesting is that the battle system seems a bit unique. Basically you make important decisions, but leave the actual to-do to mostly automated processes. On the one hand, I like telling everything what to do. On the other hand, part of the allure of being a Space Ruler is that you get to order people to do shit and make them figure it out.

So I was left to cast away the hours of practice, i.e. training, and inefficiently swim and breast stroke my way across the lake and back again. All the while my two friends were gracefully skimming across the water looking like Olympic athletes. Periodically one of them would turn back prompt me and encourage me on....on the outside I was laughing, which I tend to do in moments of hysteria, on the inside; however, there was a battle raging between sheer panic and nightmarish fear.

"8912","When the Coffins moved again in 1809, this time to Philadelphia. James Mott, a fellow teacher at Nine Partners, settled there too, taking a position in Thomas Coffin’s hardware business. On Apr. 10, 1811, he & Lucretia were married in the Pine Street Meetinghouse. They made a striking couple: he a tall, blond, kindly appearing man, dignified in demeanor & deliberate in speech; she a diminutive brunette with a high, broad forehead, intense, burning eyes, a vivacious manner, & a tart tongue (her schoolmates on Nantucket had caller her a “spitfire,” & that irrepressible trait still occasionally broke through the Quaker sweetness & serenity with which in later life it was overlaid). Despite differences in temperament, however, a complete harmony of interest subsisted between them throughout the 57 years of their married life. James Mott shared all his wife’s convictions, supported her in all her unpopular causes, &, by accompanying her on speaking tours, lent he public appearances a respectability which other feminist lectures lacked. Six children were born to them between 1812 - 1828: Anna, Thomas (who died in infancy), Maria, a second Thomas, Elizabeth, & Martha."

I realized that it was tract. I picked it up and opened it. How it got there, I have no idea. In most cases the cashier would have spotted something like that and disposed of it, but not this time. I was next in line, and holding onto the tract, I paid and left the store. I got back to Wayne’s car and began to read it out loud.

Rather than painting it in the pale skin tones of the rest of the Skorne I’ve done (e.g. Molik Karn or the Bloodrunners), I wanted to make him look really quite unhealthy. It doesn’t come out in the pictures quite as much as I’d hoped, but his skin was painted in the regular skin tones for the army, but then I hit it with a red wash, a flesh wash and (in some places) a sepia wash which all mixed together to give a really unhealthy effect. The red ended up settling to look like rashes and skin lesions, while the flesh wash added to the slightly ruddier complexion. The sepia was applied to areas where I thought sweat would build up, and so was put on under the arms, around the face a bit, and across the chest. The overall effect is fantastic, and puts me in mind of nothing so much as Baron Harkonnen from the Dune series of novels."

"8965","Qabqab was a remote and semi-isolated mountain place. Life here was simple and unpretentious. The residents connected with the pristine nature around them. They cultivated the scarce fields where the lands were flat enough for basic agricultural use. Farming was a job that guaranteed self-sufficiency, it produced enough to sustain oneself but not enough to trade and barter. But self-sufficiency was what most of the content people of Qabqab sought. And so farming for them trumped any other interest. It also made them travel less, and mingle with their neighboring villages even less frequently. Politics did not figure in Qabqab’s social life. There was no hierarchy of power. Disputes, as rare as they might be, were settled amicably. When veteran travelers and rovers sat center-stage at the village square to talk about famine, war and political dissent and events that took place elsewhere, the residents of Qabqab listened in amazement. For them, these things were inconceivable and unheard of."

"8967","I don’t know if this ball washed up or was left. I wondered where it may have come from if it had washed up. I began to analyze tides and currents, but in the process of researching, I came upon this. Better than stinky potato sponges, potato CHIPS – in airtight packaging no less! Actually they’re corn, but why be technical about it. That made me hungry, so I gave up researching to get some lunch. I’m easily distracted. I didn’t edit the top photo, but the bottom one I played with in Colorsplash."

"8970","16:00 GMT: Captain Sanogo appears on ORTM television, shown with fellow junta officers in a salon. He describes the current conflict as having been set in motion by “ill-intentioned elements” that had been infiltrating Bamako in recent days. He continues to express his support for the “accord-cadre” signed with ECOWAS a month ago. Sanogo’s brief (2 min. 30 sec.) appearance is followed by a statement by Hamadoun Touré, minister of communication in the new civilian government. Touré urges Malians to remain calm and to strive for a definitive return of constitutional rule as well as a restoration of the Malian state on all Malian territory (including the north)."

"8973","The first: April 19, 1995 - The bombing of Alfred P. Murrah building in Oklahoma City. I am a native Oklahoman. I was born and raised here. I still live here. My husband works in downtown OKC now. And on that morning, I was sitting in Mrs. Johnson's 6th grade class, when a classmate came in and said ""There was a building bombed in Oklahoma City"". No one knew what was going on, but as we started getting more information, we watched the news. At home, I watched the horror and devastation on the news. I remember the picture of the fireman holding the baby that he had brought out of the rubble. I remember our 6th grade classes learning to sign ""From a Distance"" by Bette Midler. I remember when they imploded the rest of the building...I watched it live on National t.v. I remember it all."

"8975","I read the few books I have. They’re boring, but it’s better than being alone with my own thoughts. I’ve had enough of that lately. In the evening, Josie knocks on the door and I invite her in. She’s come to check on me, under the presumption of reporting on the house. My leg is propped up on the other chair, because it hurts slightly less that way. It itches just as much though. She looks at it and frowns. She asks if it hurts, and how long it’ll take to heal. Yes, it does, and I don’t know. The bite on my neck and shoulder is nearly gone though, I don’t have to wear the scarf anymore."
"8976","Consequently, when CD opened on 125th street, I was in that bad boy every week, (Black &) proud to support their company and Mary and Jada. While I don’t share the skin tones or features as these women, it is their persona that I related to. I respected them. So when my girlfriend and I discussed Cassie, Solange and Selita, she couldn’t wrap her mind around why I didn’t dig these choices since exact skin tone hadn’t matter to me before. I simply said, “I don’t see myself in any of those ladies.” Not my looks, my style, my spirit, my anything. Reading Steve Stoute’s articulation of CD’s choice also transported me back to my awkward years. I was that young girl seeking someone to see myself in, to say that Dark Chocolate is beautiful too, that we fully embrace the full color spectrum of our sisters and want to praise them ALL."

"8985","I remember when I really knew that John was cool. We were staying at our grandmother’s in the Bronx and we all went to Sam Goody’s; it was a wonderful trip from Buffalo where we had escaped the reality of Buffalo for the reality of the Bronx, which was not that much better, but at least it wasn’t Buffalo, and it was closer to Manhattan. And we all went into this wonderful record store Sam Goody’s and came back with some records. I think I was about 14, so John was about 16; he put on an album, and, y’all forgive me, but it started to play: Dah-dah-dah-da-dah, I feel free, dah-dah-da-dah-dah, I feel free— And it was the first cut on the first album by Cream, and it was just so…it was just wonderful. And I said, “Wow, he knows something, this guy, he really knows something!” And it turned out he did know something; he had these amazing scores on his SATs."

I got caught up on house work and had some quiet moments while working to reflect. My brain works best when my body is busy. It has been so long since I had a moment like that. You know, comfortably busy but not rushed. So refreshing. It was also refreshing to have clean toilet bowls and dust free bedrooms."
